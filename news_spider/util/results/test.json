Junior  Tracklisting: 1. Topographe 2. Junior 3. Domino 4. Goldie 5. Agent double 6. Microscopie 7. Grand cheval 8. Milan 9. Pow 10. Bang   About Corridor’s  Junior : Corridor are a group from Montreal and their Sub Pop debut,  Junior , was made just yesterday. The rock’n’roll band had barely inked their record deal when they surfed into studio, racing against time to make the most dazzling, immediate and inventive album of their young career: 39 minutes of darting and dodging guitars, spiraling vocal harmonies, and the complicated, goldenrod nostalgia of a Sunday mid-afternoon.   This ain’t Corridor’s first rodeo.  Junior  is the band’s third full-length and their third recorded with their friend, producer (and occasionally roommate) Emmanuel Ethier. However 2015’s  Le Voyage Éternel and 2017’s  Supermercado  were made languorously, their songs taking shape across whole seasons. This time Dominic Berthiaume (vocals/bass), Julian Perreault (guitar), Jonathan Robert (vocals/guitar/synths), and Julien Bakvis (drums) permitted themselves no such indulgence. The band were committed to releasing an album every two years, and for Junior it required a blitz. “If you want to release something this fall, we need the masters by the 10th of May,” the label had warned them. Winter was already in its last throes: on March 1, Corridor went into studio; in mid-April, Corridor came out. They had somehow created  Junior  and it was, if we may be so bold, spectacular.   Singers, two guitars, bass, drums: the timelessness of the setup underpins the timelessness of the sound, a rock’n’roll borrowing from each of the past six decades—punk and pop, psych and jangle, daydream and swoon. This is music that’s muscular, exciting and full of love, its riffs a kind of medicine. Whereas Corridor’s past work could sometimes seem overstuffed, twenty ideas to the same song, the new work is hypnotic, distilled. “Part of the beauty of the thing is that we didn’t have time to think about it,” says Berthiaume. Six of  Junior ’s 10 tracks were conceived during a single weekend. The words to “Bang” were written on the eve of the sessions, as Robert began to panic: “Je payerai tôt ou tard,” he sings: I’ll pay, sooner or later. Fewer jams, fewer overdubs—no fortnight in the countryside, secluding themselves in a chalet. Even the artwork came in the nick of time: in spite of other, meticulous, masterpieces, Robert’s “shitty last-minute collage” (of an egg saying hello) was the one his bandmates went for.    That might be Corridor’s best trick—their mixture of seriousness and whimsy. Songs like “Miscroscopie” and the standout “Domino” are purposeful, full of songcraft, even as they let loose, slip their collar. “Topographe“‘s all call and answer, like rival Cupids shooting arrows at each other across a ravine. “Pow” and “Goldie” are like hurtling racecars, or teams of horses, accelerating towards a memory. And Junior’s title track—by turns twitchy and anthemic—is in fact a tribute to Perreault, their “joueur étoile,” star player: in spite of his disappointed parents (“parents déçus”), he’s Corridor’s VIP. Junior’s ten tracks are filled with tributes like this, impressionistic portraits of characters in the band-members’ lives. Their tone is affectionate, the meaning hazy—even if you speak French.   Sub Pop have never before, in their 33-year history, signed a Francophone act. Maybe the band’s magic springs from their ingenious hooks, their topaz-tinted vision. Maybe it’s the panache of Québec’s insurgent underground scene, or the camaraderie of Robert and Berthiaume, who have played together since they were 14. Maybe it’s their name—a hallway crossed with a toreador. Probably it’s all of these, and none of them:  Junior  is a joy, a hasty miracle, because it’s so much damn fun to listen to. This album is 39 minutes; each day has 24 hours; you can listen 36 times before tomorrow. [Photo Credit:  Dominic Berthiaume of Corridor] What people are saying about Corridor: “The Montreal band Corridor knows how to highlight its strengths while getting in and out of a song with maximum efficiency: Sung in French, “Coup d’épée” only needs a little more than two minutes to let its robust guitar sound — a kind of weaponized jangle — fully worm its way in your head.” [“Coup d’épée” /  Supermercado ] -  NPR Music   “ Supermercado  is the best French record of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and even 2022 (for all we know, at least, since I doubt the Earth will explode exactly at midnight on January 1, 2022, even if it’s a possibility we shouldn’t ignore).” -  Vice   “ Their jangly, synth-pop-tinged sound will entrance fans of the genre and post-punk newbies alike. On their latest LP, Supermercado, post-punk fans will gravitate towards their tight, neat percussion and spasmodic guitars while others will get lost in their bright vocals and spellbinding soundscapes.” [ Supermercado ] -  PASTE   “Corridor sing entirely en Français. Don’t let that put you off though: the creativity and abundance of killer tunes found on their acid-baked 2017 album Supermercado breaks through the language barrier. Corridor are even better live, with a real joie de rock that knows no borders — guitars slash, harmonies soar, bodies a constant blur.” [ Supermercado ] -  Brooklyn Vegan"},

Butler seems to rap in dialogue with himself, detailing a threatening streetscape and shaping the experience into personal realizations.  In the  “Seven Wheel Motion” visual , the song soundtracks the fantastical “Twin Queen Tryst” short film. Set in an alien landscape, a queen (played by Rhonda Faison of Shabazz Palaces “Déesse Du Sang” video) sends her royal subject (played by The Palaceer) on a quest for a magical jewel. Along the way, he encounters a mystical being (played by OCnotes) who helps the subject with his quest to return the jewel to the queen. This wild new video also features scene art by Olde Nightrifter and cinematography from Futsum Tsegai.  Knife Knights (The Palaceer aka Ishmael Butler, Erik Blood, OCnotes and Marquetta Miller) have a scheduled performance in Seattle on Wednesday, October 16th at Earshot Jazz Festival (at the Langston Hughes Performing Arts Institute).

Now Watch a Lyric Video For Its Menacing Lead Single, “Nothing Is Safe” ", "date": "WED, AUG 14, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "Clipping  has returned with  There Existed an Addiction to Blood , the group’s fourth effort and the follow up to  Splendor and Misery,  their acclaimed album of 2016.  There Existed an Addiction to Blood  features the singles  “Nothing Is Safe,”  “Blood of the Fang,” “La Mala Ordina” (Feat.

There Existed an Addiction to Blood  finds Clipping interpreting another rap splinter sect through their singular lens. This is Clipping’s transmutation of horrorcore, a purposefully absurdist and creatively significant sub-genre that flourished in the mid-90s. If some of its most notable pioneers included Brotha Lynch Hung and Gravediggaz, it also encompasses seminal works from the Geto Boys, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, and the near-entirety of classic Memphis cassette tape rap. The most subversive and experimental rap has often presented itself as an “alternative” to conventional sounds, but Clipping respectfully warp them into new constellations.  There Existed an Addiction to Blood  absorbs the hyper-violent horror tropes of the Murder Dog era, but re-imagines them in a new light: still darkly-tinted and somber, but in a weirder and more vivid hue. If traditional horrorcore was akin to  Blacula , the hugely popular blaxploitation flick from the early 70s, Clipping’s latest is analogous to  Ganja & Hess , the blood-sipping 1973 cult classic regarded as an unsung landmark of black independent cinema, whose score by Sam Waymon, the band samples on “Blood of the Fang” and inspired the album’s title.

Avoid future FOMO by following Clipping everywhere in space and time:  Facebook  |  Instagram  |  Twitter  |  clppng.com  |  subpop.com [ Photo Credit: Cristina Bercovitz ] About Clipping’s  There Existed an Addiction to Blood : The science-fiction visionary Octavia Butler once declared that “there is nothing new under the sun, but there are new suns.” The aphorism could apply to any art form where the basic contours are fixed, but the appetite for innovation remains infinite. Enter Clipping, flash fiction genre masters in a hip-hop world firmly rooted in memoir. If first-person confessionals historically reign, the mid-city Los Angeles trio of rapper Daveed Diggs and producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes have spent the last half-decade terraforming their own patch of soil, replete with conceptual labyrinths and industrial chaos. They have conjured a mutant emanation of the future, built at odd angles atop the hallowed foundation of the past.   Their third album for Sub Pop,  There Existed an Addiction to Blood , finds them interpreting another rap splinter sect through their singular lens. This is clipping’s transmutation of horrorcore, a purposefully absurdist and creatively significant sub-genre that flourished in the mid-90s. If some of its most notable pioneers included Brotha Lynch Hung and Gravediggaz, it also encompasses seminal works from the Geto Boys, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, and Three 6 Mafia and the near-entirety of classic Memphis cassette tape rap.   The most subversive and experimental rap has often presented itself as an “alternative” to conventional sounds, but Clipping respectfully warp them into new constellations.  There Existed an Addiction to Blood  absorbs the hyper-violent horror tropes of the Murder Dog era, but re-imagines them in a new light: still darkly-tinted and somber, but in a weirder and more vivid hue. If traditional horrorcore was akin to  Blacula , the hugely popular blaxploitation flick from the early 70s, Clipping’s latest is analogous to  Ganja & Hess , the blood-sipping 1973 cult classic regarded as an unsung landmark of black independent cinema, whose score by Sam Waymon, the band samples on “Blood of the Fang” and inspired the album’s title.   From the opening “Intro,” Clipping summon an unsettling eeriness. Diggs sounds like he’s rapping through a drive-thru speaker about the bottom falling out, bodies hitting the floor, and recurrent ghosts. You hear ambient noises, footsteps and shovels. The hairs on your arms stick up like bayonets. You can practically see the knife’s edge, sharp and luminous.   Each song contains its own premise and conceptual bent. There is “Nothing is Safe,” a reversal of  Assault on Precinct 13 , where the band create their own version of a John Carpenter-inspired rap beat and the cops are the ones raiding a trap house. Diggs sketches the narrative from the perspective of the victims, full of lurid and visceral details and intricate wordplay. The windows are boarded and sealed, the product simmers on the stove, the bodies sleep fitfully in shifts. Then law enforcement arrives and the bullets start to fly.   “He Dead” turns police officers into werewolves while Diggs flips Kendrick Lamar’s “Riggamortis” into something gravely literal.“All In Your Head” finds Clipping re-contextualizing the pimp talk of Suga Free and Too $hort into a metaphor for an  Exorcist -style possession. The album contains interludes featuring hissing recordings of demonic invasions and guest appearances from Griselda Gang’s Benny the Butcher and Hypnotize Minds horror queen La Chat. Other tracks feature contributions from noise music legends The Rita and Pedestrian Deposit. It all ends with “Piano Burning,” a performance of a piece written by the avant-garde composer Annea Lockwood. Yes, it is the sound of a piano burning.    In the hands of the less imaginative or less virtuosic, it could come off as overwrought or pretentious. Instead, Clipping annex new terrain for a sub-genre often left for dead. In its own way, one could compare what they’ve accomplished to Tarantino’s post-modern reworkings of critically overlooked but creatively fertile blaxploitation, horror and spaghetti western cinema.   Everything fits neatly into the broader scope of the band’s career, which has seen them expand from insular experimentalists into globally recognized artists. Since the release of their first album in 2013, Diggs has won a Tony and a Grammy, as well as co-written and starred in 2018’s critically hailed  Blindspotting , while Snipes and Hutson have scored numerous films and television shows.   Clipping’s last album, the 2016 afro-futurist dystopian space opus Splendor & Misery  was recently named one of  Pitchfork ’s Best Industrial Albums of All-Time. Commissioned for an episode of  This American Life , their 2017 single “The Deep” became the inspiration for a novel of the same name, written by Rivers Solomon and published by Saga Press. But it’s their latest masterwork that embodies what the band had been building towards — a work that finds them without peer. This is experimental hip-hop built to bang in a post-apocalyptic club bursting with radiation. It’s horror-core that soaks up past blood and replants it into a different organism, undead but dangerously alive. It is a new sun, blindingly bright and built to burn your retinas."},

{"title": "Watch Omni’s New Video for Lead Single “Sincerely Yours” Off Their Sub Pop Debut ‘Networker’ (out November 1st)", "date": "TUE, AUG 13, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "North American & European tour dates announced. On November 1st,  Omni  will release their Sub Pop debut  Networker . The first single, “Sincerely Yours”, delivers a tight groove accompanied by smart leads. Elements that have become a definitive part of Omni’s immediately recognizable sound. However, there is a new sonic brilliance to this recording. If spring single, “Delicacy”, was a taste for what was to come, “Sincerely Yours” lifts the curtain to reveal their lush, new sound.   Networker’s  11 tracks were written between tours and a handful of studio sessions, allowing Omni’s Frankie Broyles and Philip Frobos to push their songwriting boundaries while keeping the stage in mind, designing songs to enhance their tight, energetic performances. Longtime collaborator, Nathaniel Higgins returned to help capture what is their most “HI-FI” album to date. Together they recorded the LP in Vienna, GA between November 2018 - April 2019. [ Photo Credit: Emily Frobos ] Elaborating on the inspiration behind “Sincerely Yours”, Frobos shares that “The last couple of years marked a lot of friends making the 9 to 5 career change. While I’m aware that there are many advantages to that lifestyle, the song is written from an outsider’s perspective while remaining close to their struggles.” You can watch the new video for “Sincerely Yours” right here, and also  here .   The band has announced a 26 date world tour this fall in support of their Sub Pop debut   Networker . The North American run will kick off on Oct. 23rd in Nashville, and find the group touring through Chicago, Brooklyn, DC, and Raleigh, ending in their home city of Atlanta on Nov. 4th. They will then head overseas beginning on Nov. 10th in Kortrijk, Belgium with shows in Hamburg, Copenhagen, Berlin, Paris, Lille, Brighton, Glasgow, and London. See below for a full list of shows.    Networker is  now available for preorder from Sub Pop.

Their sound is still defined by sparse drums, locked-in bass, blistering guitar, and nonchalant, yet assured vocals, but from the first notes of “Sincerely Yours” you’ll immediately notice that  Networker  sounds much cleaner and more “HI-FI” than their prior two albums,  Deluxe  (2016) and  Multi-task  (2017). The departure in fidelity suits the new record and allows the listener to enjoy the nuances of their meticulous arrangements. Don’t worry, the riffs of Gang of Four and Wire are still present, but the production is more lush and the harmony is even more expansive.  Despite nods to the sounds of the ’70s and ’80s what comes through is a record fully rooted in the here and now.  Thematically, this is apparent on the title track “Networker” taking a candid snapshot of the “digital you” aspect of life in the age of the internet.  The otherwise fun romp “Skeleton Key” also acknowledges the “direct message and obsessive” side of social media with lines like “if you don’t like what you see, the pretty face on the screen, scroll on by…”     Networker  was written half between tours and half during recording sessions. The band, Philip Frobos on bass/vocals and Frankie Broyles on guitars/drums/keys, returned with longtime collaborator Nathaniel Higgins to the studio in South Georgia where they also recorded  Multi-task  and most recent single “Delicacy.” In this case, the “studio” is a cabin near Vienna, GA (pronounced Vye-anna) that was built by Frankie Broyles’ great-grandparents in the 1940s. The band completed four sessions between November 2018 and April 2019. Omni hit their stride in the cabin with songs such as “Moat,” which cruises along at a nice mid-tempo clip with sounds that are  maybe  piano or  maybe  the “behind the bridge” strings of a Jaguar a la Sonic Youth or This Heat.  “Blunt Force” provides a nice contrast to some of the more upbeat cuts, getting jazzy with it’s less traditional arrangement and psychedelic outro.   On “Courtesy Call,” Omni successfully ride the line of being able to pleasantly reference influences without mimicking. They venture into experimental Haruomi Hosono territory while still managing to sound like Thin Lizzy. The same could be applied to “Sincerely Yours” where the fantastic guitar work and a beautiful breakdown in the middle dive into late 70’s jazz production.  On standout cut “Present Tense,” Yellow Magic Orchestra vibes are present in the fun synthesizer riff while the guitar counterpoint checks this direction pulling the song back into something fresh, sharp, and definitely Omni.      Overall,  Networker  is simultaneously fun, catchy, and contains some truly impressive musicianship. This combo is especially hard to pull off as bands that are great players often don’t have great or memorable songs. Omni and Nathaniel Higgins have done a stellar job of reigning in their diverse influences into a cohesive record by curating their sounds into a tight package that leaves you just on the cusp of understanding where the band is coming from, while still feeling like you’re hearing something totally fresh. While their earlier records had more of a “post-punk” sound,  Networker  is an amalgamation of the best sounds of the ’70s and ’80s, all arranged with (mostly) guitars, bass, and drums for our contemporary age, and it really works! There are hooks everywhere, vocal and instrumental, that will leave you humming along, even during the first listen. As Philip Frobos says in “Present Tense,” “guess who’s on my mind right now?” Well, Omni’s on mine and will be on yours soon. - Scott Munro, Preoccupations 2019"},
{"title": "Watch Frankie Cosmos’ New Video for “Wannago” Featuring Comedian Catherine Cohen", "date": "MON, AUG 12, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "Close it Quietly , available worldwide on September 6th via Sub Pop. On September 6th, Sub Pop will release  Frankie Cosmos ’ fourth studio album,  Close It Quietly . This album is a manifestation of the band’s collaborative spirit: Greta Kline and longtime bandmates Lauren Martin (synth), Luke Pyenson (drums), and Alex Bailey (bass) luxuriated in studio time with Gabe Wax, who engineered and co-produced the record with the band at Brooklyn’s Figure 8 Studios.    The bands latest video for “Wannago” features comedian  Catherine Cohen  and was directed by the fine folks at House of Nod. The video is centered around the band’s love for reality baking shows, specifically  The Great British Bake Off . “I thought a baking competition theme would translate well to a music video. In some ways I think the lighthearted drama, tension, and release of that format mirrors the ebb and flow of emotions (lyrically and musically) in this song, and so it was kind of a natural fit” says drummer Luke Pyenson. You can watch the video for the song here and also  here. When asked about the song, Kline had this to share “Wannago is an older song that I thought would never come out. Every time we ever tried to arrange it we gave up or lied that we would come back to it later. It felt too hard, and I found some of the lyrics embarrassing. Then Alex encouraged us to give it another shot because he really loved the demo. We ended up all working together to turn this into a song that feels sparkly and distinct; and it’s really fun to play. I’ve accepted the cheesier lyrics as part of the youthful glow of the song, it feels very wide-eyed and is purely about love, distance, and life.” Frankie Cosmos has announced a World Tour, splitting these shows into three legs. The first leg of dates will begin on September 18 in Boston, MA, and end on Sep. 29 in their hometown of New York City which will include an opening comedy set from “Wannago” video star Catherine Cohen. They will then head overseas beginning on Oct. 8th in Munich, Germany with shows in Prague, Amsterdam, and Paris, ending on Oct. 22nd in London.

{"title": "Hear Marika Hackman’s “all night,” An Alluring New Standout From ‘Any Human Friend’ (out August 9th)", "date": "THU, JUL 25, 2019 at 800 AM", "preview": "Today,  Marika Hackman  releases the grunge laced, x-rated track “all night” ahead of the release of her new album  Any Human Friend,  out August 9th via  Sub Pop in North and South America  and AMF Records for the rest of the world.   “all night” leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination, a song with a laid back groove that belies the up-front, no holds barred lyricism on show.    Marika on the single: “I thought it would be exciting to write a really overtly sexual song about a woman from the perspective of a woman. You don’t hear much about sex between women in music, or if you do its usually from a fetishised male perspective, I thought I’d reclaim a bit of that power”.   Marika is a ‘ Rid of Me’ -era PJ Harvey for the inclusive generation: unbounded by musical genre, a preternatural lyricist and tunesmith who isn’t afraid to  go there.  Hackman’s 2015 debut,  We Slept at Last , was heralded for being nuanced and atmospheric. She really found her footing with her last release,  I’m Not Your Man , and its exceptional, swaggering international hit  “Boyfriend,”  which boasts of seducing away a straight guy’s girlfriend.  Any Human Friend  is a step-up again for Marika. There’s a sense of liberation, a sense of sexual freedom, and being a solo entity again - and working out what that means.

The Eternal Voyage).  While they labored on the record, they were also each invested in their own creative pursuits.  Singer and guitarist Jonathan dove into his animation and illustration work (This would later prove useful as he has assumed the role of the band’s creative director, setting the tone for the visual aesthetic of their records and videos); Dominic began writing as a music journalist and photographer for outlets in Canada; And Julian continued pursuing an environmental design career, working on installations for well-known music festivals.    In the spring of 2015, the group released  Le Voyage Éternel  via L’oeil du Tigre Records, and plans for their first European tour began to take shape.  Marc-André departed the band shortly after the record’s release and was replaced by current drummer Julien Bakvis.  Julien, like his bandmates, works in visual arts as a co-owner of a screen-printing shop in Montreal. This group (Jonathan Robert, Julian Perreault, Dominic Berthiaume, and Julien Bakvis), has become the permanent lineup of the band.  That year Corridor toured Europe for the first time, including a show in Paris, promoted by “La Souterraine,” where they met the mystic psych-pop outfit Halo Maud (with whom they would later collaborate on the single Deux Coeurs  (tr. Two Hearts). 2016 was predominantly spent writing and recording. Corridor returned to the studio with Emmanuel Ethier to record their follow-up LP  Supermercado  (tr. Supermarket).  Repetition, progression, and minimalist rhythms would be the core of  Supermercado , with melodic counterpoints coming together to form exhilarating sonic mosaics. The cult success of the album allowed Corridor to return to Europe, as well as make their first foray into the United States at SXSW 2018.  That year in Austin they played notable showcases for Brooklyn Vegan , Margin Walker, Felte/Part-time Punks, and M for Montreal. In 2018 Corridor also appeared at Northside Music Festival in Brooklyn, where they performed with the likes of Snail Mail, Deerhoof, and Protomartyr. Shortly thereafter, they returned to the U.S. supporting U.K. post-punks Shame. They even found a fan in actor Michael Shannon who attended the show in Chicago and he requested a CD from the band. In April of 2019, Corridor accompanied the band Crumb on a sold-out American tour. Then in May of 2019, they followed with performances at London Calling Festival in Amsterdam and La Villette Sonique Festival in Paris.     Corridor will release their Sub Pop debut later this year.    What “The People” are saying about Corridor: “The Montreal band Corridor knows how to highlight its strengths while getting in and out of a song with maximum efficiency: Sung in French, “Coup d’épée” only needs a little more than two minutes to let its robust guitar sound — a kind of weaponized jangle — fully worm its way in your head.” [“Coup d’épée” /  Supermercado ] -  NPR Music   “ Supermercado  is the best French record of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and even 2022 (for all we know, at least, since I doubt the Earth will explode exactly at midnight on January 1, 2022, even if it’s a possibility we shouldn’t ignore).” -  Vice   “ Their jangly, synth-pop-tinged sound will entrance fans of the genre and post-punk newbies alike. On their latest LP,  Supermercado , post-punk fans will gravitate towards their tight, neat percussion and spasmodic guitars while others will get lost in their bright vocals and spellbinding soundscapes.” [ Supermercado ] -  PASTE “Corridor sing entirely en Français. Don’t let that put you off though: the creativity and abundance of killer tunes found on their acid-baked 2017 album  Supermercado  break through the language barrier. Corridor are even better live, with a real joie de rock that knows no borders — guitars slash, harmonies soar, bodies a constant blur.” [ Supermercado ] -  Brooklyn Vegan"},

Don’t be so close-minded to think you’re the only one who’s got issues, in fact, find comfort in the thought that everyone is on their own journey” Lay explains. What starts as an Eastern-influenced song morphs into an avant-garde sound bath. “I had this idea of the violin ascending. Then Mikal Cronin came in with the saxophone and just blew me away.  I love the idea of building a song like that, take people by surprise.”  August is now available for preorder from Sub Pop.

On September 6th, Sub Pop will release  Frankie Cosmos ’ fourth studio album,  Close It Quietly . This album is a manifestation of the band’s collaborative spirit: Greta Kline and longtime bandmates Lauren Martin (synth), Luke Pyenson (drums), and Alex Bailey (bass) luxuriated in studio time with Gabe Wax, who engineered and co-produced the record with the band at Brooklyn’s Figure 8 Studios. Early this year, Frankie Cosmos released  Haunted Items , a digital-only collection of new stripped-down songs for the piano which the band’s latest single, “Rings (On A Tree)”, first appeared. As the band’s frontwoman Greta Kline describes, it’s “a fictional tale of a breakup from the point of view of a mistress. After I wrote it I realized what it meant to me– even though I’ve never been a mistress, I related to the character from being in a relationship where my feelings weren’t prioritized. I originally wrote it just on piano and released the solo version that way. The band version really takes it somewhere else and felt very collaborative. I love everyone’s parts. Alex wrote the funky guitar part I play in the middle section, based on an idea Luke and Lauren verbalized.” You can listen to the band version of “Rings (On A Tree) above, and also by clicking  here.   [ Photo credit: Jackie Lee Young ] Frankie Cosmos Tour Dates + Ticket Links Frankie Cosmos has announced a World Tour, splitting these shows into three legs.

{"title": "Watch Preservation Hall Jazz Band’s Official Video For “Keep Your Head Up” From ‘A Tuba to Cuba’ Featuring Cuban singer Eme Alfonso", "date": "MON, JUL 15, 2019 at 800 AM", "preview": "Preservation Hall Jazz Band  has released the video for their song “ Keep Your Head Up ” today, premiered  via  Billboard . The track, which features\r\nCuban singer  Eme Alfonso , appears on\r\ntheir new album  A Tuba To Cuba,  the\r\nsoundtrack to the critically acclaimed documentary directed by  T.G. Herrington  and  Danny Clinch,  out now via  Sub Pop.  Watch and share “Keep Your\r\nHead Up”  here . Stream\r\nand order  A Tuba to Cuba   here .  “Keep Your Head Up” is simple message with a big meaning,” says  Ben Jaffe .  “Walk with your head\r\nhigh, walk with pride, and live your life with grace and honor and an\r\nappreciation for all humanity.  Don’t let things break you down and don’t\r\nallow anyone or anything to diminish your spirit.” “We met the wonderful Eme Alfonso at a performance at an amazing old factory that’s\r\nbeen converted into a multi-disciplinary art space called Fabrica Del\r\nArte.  That same evening we met she came up and improvised lyrics in\r\nSpanish on the spot. Eme later told me the words she sang have a deep meaning\r\nin Cuba,  the translation is something like “walk with your head out\r\nfront, don’t be so down, walk with joy.” “ To say Preservation Hall\r\nJazz Band is to refer to the purest essence of our traditions and to discover\r\nNOLA, through the band and Ben its director, was for me one of the most beautiful\r\nexperiences of my life,” says singer  Eme\r\nAlfonso . “Because in New Orleans… Jazz and art flow from the streets\r\nof this city and it’s clear that it has a direct connection to Cuba, Havana,\r\nand all of those who came before us. Our grandparents are connected\r\nthrough these rhythms, dances, melodies, and customs and this shared history of\r\nour ancestors unites us all.  \r\n \r\n“New Orleans and Cuba are deeply connected,” Alfonso continues. “This\r\ncollaboration is a conduit, a lesson to show our people, and others in the\r\nworld that we are all family and that art and music has the power to unites us.” “We went to Cuba in prayer position,” says Preservation Hall band\r\nleader and bass player Ben Jaffe when he speaks of the pilgrimage he and the\r\ngroup took to Cuba in December 2015. “We went to receive and offer at the same\r\ntime. We had never experienced a moment like this, it felt as though all roads\r\nwere intersecting at once.” The critically acclaimed 2019 documentary  A   Tuba\r\nto Cuba  documented the band’s journey as they explored the links that\r\nconnect New Orleans and Cuba so indelibly – their shared, tragic history as\r\ndestinations where enslaved Africans struggled to simply survive, and their\r\ncurrent status as places where the cultural inheritance from those ancestors is\r\nkept alive in both song and deed – but that was only half the story. This\r\ncollection of songs, a musical account of a\r\ngenerations-in-the-making reunion of musical\r\nfamilies separated by time, politics, and distance, tells the other\r\nhalf. When\r\nasked to describe the collection of songs assembled on  Tuba to Cuba , Jaffe s ums it up by saying,\r\n“It’s like listening to the radio.”  And yes,  A \r\n Tuba to Cuba  actually feels less like\r\nan ordinary soundtrack and more like a living document, a recording of a\r\nbroadcast that’s been waiting to exist, a modern version of the static-y radio\r\nsignals that were broadcast between America to the Caribbean in the early and\r\nmid-20th century, sending the sounds of jazz and mambo and R&B and more back\r\nand forth across the vast divides of water and culture and politics. It’s a\r\nstory, this album, and the tale being told mirrors the band’s experience. The resulting\r\ncollection of songs is what Jaffe describes\r\nas “a beautiful conversation.” The music of  A \r\n Tuba to Cuba  is an ecstatic expression of that ongoing conversation, a\r\nrestless and lush trip up and down strange FM wavelengths bridging thousands of\r\nmiles and hundreds of years, where all involved are\r\ntalking with each other and over each other in excitement, charged with the\r\nthrill of recognition of the evidence of their shared familial roots, an\r\nundeniable kinship rooted in bloodlines, rhythm, and melody.

He has a range and depth that is showcased\r\nbeautifully on this new album, his third on Sub Pop, and first as Kyle Craft\r\n& Showboat Honey. “ -  Eleven PDX “On\r\nthe track, his typically wailing voice is stunted by almost spoken-word verses\r\nthat ride along with a slow-rolling piano progression. It’s a suspense-building\r\nelement that pays off when the song eventually crashes into a wave of horns,\r\nelectric guitars and sheer swagger.” [“Broken Mirror Pose”/ Heavy Rotation] -  World\r\nCafe “A\r\nglammy, ’70s style anthem with a soaring chorus.”  [“Broken Mirror Pose”] -  Brooklyn Vegan “Craft,\r\nwhose lyrics and electric guitar hooks have drawn comparisons to Bob Dylan and\r\nThe Rolling Stones, is no stranger to vintage sounds.” [“Broken Mirror\r\nPose”] -  PASTE “Craft\r\nhas brought his signature twang into a more Raconteurs-esque world with his\r\nlatest release.” [2 Ugly 4 NY] -  Alt Citizen [Photo credit: Peter Karaviaw]"},
{"title": "METZ 12 Single Collection ‘Automat’ is Out In Stores Today, July 12th", "date": "FRI, JUL 12, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "METZ , our own widely-adored and delightfully noisy 3-piece punk band from Toronto, released their Sub Pop self-titled debut in 2012 and, in the time since, have cemented their reputation as one of the planet’s most exhilarating live acts and trusted providers of bombastic outsider rock. The band is made up of Alex Edkins, Hayden Menzies, and Chris Slorach.  Automat  is a collection of METZ non-album singles, B-sides, and rarities dating back to 2009, available  here  on LP for the first time, and including the band’s long out-of-print early (pre-Sub Pop) recordings. A chronological trip through the lesser known material of METZ,  Automat  is out now, worldwide on Sub Pop.   The band’s Alex Edkins shares, “The idea to release  Automat  came after realizing our early 7” singles were being sold online for upwards of $60 bucks a pop. We wanted to make those songs available and affordable to anyone who might want them in the physical format. What started as reissuing a couple of 45s, quickly morphed into an entire LP, compiling rarities, demos and alternate takes from over the years.” Consumers of the  vinyl format  of  Automat  will be rewarded with a bonus single that includes three additional tracks: a cover of Sparklehorse’s “Pig,” from a very limited 2012 Record Store Day split single originally released by Toronto’s Sonic Boom record shop; “I’m a Bug,” a cover of The Urinals’ art-punk classic, originally released on YouTube (not an actual record label) in 2014; and METZ’s previously unreleased rendition of Gary Numan’s “M.E.” METZ are currently hard at work on their 4th full-length LP which will be released on Sub Pop when we are all damn good and ready.   All tracks on  Automat  have been lovingly remastered by Matthew Barnhart at Chicago Mastering Service."},

I loved the idea of inhabiting this ridiculous arrogant rock star character who has totally fucked their career by writing too many sad songs.” The video for “the one” sees Marika’s rock star alter-ego come to life within a photocopier. By the end of the video, Marika is repulsed by the augmented reality she has created, she takes a baseball bat to it and destroys it forever.    Director Louis Bhose reflects on the process of the video’s conception:   Marika: “I want to do a performance vid in a photocopier, where the imagined rockstar in me performs with gusto as the mediocre, let-down version of me watches.”  Hack Video Director: “Say no more.”   Displaying an unapologetic attitude and a more liberated sound than ever before, “the one” has been co-produced by David Wrench (Frank Ocean, The xx, Let’s Eat Grandma) and Marika herself. “the one” shows why Marika is fast turning herself into one of the most exciting songwriters of her time. Layered synthesizers make this the album’s most unexpected musical turn, alongside Marika’s signature new wave guitar fretwork and Blondie style delivery, she’s never sounded as widescreen.

Listen and share “Keep Your Head Up”  here  and\r\npre-order  A Tuba to Cuba   here . “We are so proud and honored to share a project\r\nwe’ve poured so much of ourselves into,”  says  Ben\r\nJaffe . “The impact visiting Cuba had on us will live with us both\r\nindividually and as a band forever. We’re still absorbing everything we\r\nexperienced.” “We went to Cuba in prayer position,” says Preservation Hall band\r\nleader and bass player Ben Jaffe when he speaks of the pilgrimage he and the\r\ngroup took to Cuba in December 2015. “We went to receive an offer at the same\r\ntime.

Now Watch The New Video for Lead Single “Windows” ", "date": "TUE, JUN 18, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "On September 6th, Sub Pop will release Frankie Cosmos’ fourth studio album,  Close It Quietly . This album is a manifestation of the band’s collaborative spirit: Greta Kline and longtime bandmates Lauren Martin (synth), Luke Pyenson (drums), and Alex Bailey (bass) luxuriated in studio time with Gabe Wax, who engineered and co-produced the record with the band.   Recording close to home — at Brooklyn’s Figure 8 Studios— grounded the band, and their process was enriched by working closely with Wax, whose intuition and attention to detail made the familiar unfamiliar and allowed the band to reshape their own contexts.  Close It Quietly  is a continual reframing of the known, taking the band’s trademark micro-universe and upending it, spilling outwards into a swirl of referentiality that’s a marked departure from earlier releases, imagining and reimagining motifs and sounds throughout the album.     The synergy of its collaboration is clear upon listening to the debut offering “Windows.” “This song takes place during the waiting period of healing, not knowing how to proceed or how to find the path to forgiveness. The inner versus the outer- learning to see yourself as part of the whole. For me the lyrics cover some of the slow movements of relationships, the shifts that occur in ways of thinking over time,”  says frontperson Greta Kline. You can watch the new video for “Windows” which was directed by Eliza Doyle and Greta Kline above, and also  here .   Frankie Cosmos has announced a World Tour, splitting these shows into three legs.

It’s like giving yourself a haircut or rearranging your room. You know your hair. You know your room. Here’s the same hair, the same room, seen again as something new.  Close It Quietly  takes the trademark Frankie Cosmos micro-universe and upends it, spilling outwards into a swirl of referentiality that’s a marked departure from earlier releases, imagining and reimagining motifs and sounds throughout the album. FC’s fourth studio release is a manifestation of the band’s collaborative spirit: Greta Kline and longtime bandmates Lauren Martin (synth), Luke Pyenson (drums), and Alex Bailey (bass) luxuriated in studio time with Gabe Wax, who engineered and co-produced the record with the band.   Recording close to home— at Brooklyn’s Figure 8 Studios— grounded the band, and their process was enriched by working closely with Wax, whose intuition and attention to detail made the familiar unfamiliar and allowed the band to reshape their own contexts. On opener “Moonsea,” an unaccompanied Greta begins, “The world is crumbling and I don’t have much to say.” Take that as a wink and a metonym for the whole album, as her signature vocals are joined by Alex’s ascending bassline and Lauren’s eddying synths, invoking a loungey take on Broadcast or Stereolab’s space-disco experimental pop. There’s much more than “not much” to say here, and it’s augmented and expanded by experimentation with synth patches, textures, and other recording nuances courtesy of Wax.   As the lineup has solidified into the most permanent expression of full-band Frankie Cosmos, the bandmates have felt more comfortable deviating from their default instruments and contributing bigger-picture ideas to continue pushing the sound forward. The synergy of its creation is clear upon listening: the multiple hands dipping and re-dipping into each song form a multifaceted whole. The band’s closeness and aesthetic consistency freed its members to take more musically-formal risks, notes Luke: “Everything will sound like Frankie Cosmos because Greta has such a distinct voice (literally and figuratively). We have so much latitude to experiment with the instrumental music, and this time around we really took advantage of that.”   The album forms its own vortex of reinvention that’s embodied through both the tracks themselves and the recording and arranging processes. “A Joke” curls in on itself, in word and indeed, a series of undercuts defining negative space: “It’s just a joke I wasn’t trying to tell;” “It wasn’t really a game;” “I do not know what I am for/I wasn’t really keeping score.” Inverting technology’s human mimicry, Luke impersonates a drum machine until the song’s end. “A Joke’s” tricks scratch at something bigger, a small song embodying the laughability of attempting to neatly organize or adhere to any particular role.   “Rings of a Tree” frees itself from its original context: released earlier this year on Greta’s solo piano album Haunted Items, she didn’t initially anticipate a major deviation; then, Luke says, “Lauren and I had the same arrangement idea without talking about it. Like, ‘let’s make this song funky. Let’s channel Orange Juice.’ We texted Greta and Alex before practice and Alex came in with a new guitar part that perfectly captured what Lauren and I heard in our heads.”   “I’m just fucking glad for my bubble/despite how often it is penetrated by evil” Greta sings on “Last Season’s Textures,” taking to task the accusation that young people cloister themselves in complacency: she’s quick to point to, thank, and feel suspicious of that sphere all at once. The song explores the feeling of safety in her realm; reasonable despair re: reality (“the news is excruciating”); and a quick admission that darkness isn’t something a liberal-minded social network can block out. Kline notes how the song is “partly about misogyny and internalized misogyny–moments where I’ve felt betrayed by what is meant to be a safe space.”   Without losing any intimacy of prior albums,  Close it Quietly  is different, is  outer . The album functions as a benign doppelganger, a shadow self of past releases; where other Frankie Cosmos records shine brightest looking inward,  Close it Quietly  refracts the self into the world, and vice versa, miraculously echoing Thoreau’s assertion that “when I reflect, I find that there is other than me.” Reflection–and refraction–isn’t tidy. “Flowers don’t grow/in an organized way/why should I?” Greta sings on “A Joke.” Growth isn’t linear. Change happens in circles. While recording the album, Alex says, “I closed my eyes a lot.” Stand in the sun, listen to  Close it Quietly , and do the same."},
{"title": "Sub Pop Signs Hip-Hop Duo Cartel Madras. Now Watch The Official Video For “Pork and Leek” From Their Debut Mixtape TRAPISTAN", "date": "MON, JUN 17, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "[ Photo credit: Tom McKay ] Sub Pop has signed  Cartel Madras , a hip-hop duo who are spearheading a new genre of trap music, Goonda rap. Madras-born sisters Eboshi and Contra are known for their confrontational, high-energy and sexually commanding style of rap; this rising duo flaunts their South Indian identity with authority and expresses their gender and sexuality with a candor that is imperative to why and how Cartel Madras exists. We will release new music from the group in the near future, but for now check out the official video for  “Pork and Leek” from  TRAPISTAN , their debut mixtape from 2018.   Ishmael Butler, who signed the group had this to say, “The energy and passion they bring combined with their superior rapping skills makes the Cartel a must hear and see. Excitement is the main ingredient of their magic. On record and on stage they glow under the spotlight. They’re electric, totally tapped into the current. And c’mon two fly sisters spitting heat? Real rare…it’s too good.”   Cartel Madras has a few Canadian festival shows on the horizon, including Calgary’s Sled Island on June 21st, Hillside Festival in Guelph, Ontario on July 12th, Ottawa’s Bluesfest on July 13th, and Up Here Fest in Sudbury, Ontario on August 17th.   More on Cartel Madras: Owning sexuality, racial identity, and gender identity are recurring themes in Cartel Madras’ music. Though these themes are already present in hip hop, Cartel pushes them to even more subversive places by applying them to immigrant women. In this way, Ebosthi and Contra created Cartel Madras as a mission to authentically represent the underrepresented.   Their live performances—which boldly combine elements of the underground trap, queer, and punk scenes—have been compared to full-blown riots. After just one year, word of mouth grew so profoundly that Cartel Madras had amassed a loyal organic following and media coverage. Their debut mixtape,  TRAPISTAN , captures this live energy. Contra and Eboshi enter the world of trap loudly, abrasively, unapologetically—signaling to their growing fan base that they intend to bring something entirely new to hip hop. Over booming beats, the sisters’ rap with ease through a new genre that brings together trap, house, and gangster rap with the narratives of being Tamil born, immigrant raised, and sexually empowered as women of color and women who are queer. Cartel Madras TRAPISTAN Tracklisting: 1. Red Notice 2. Housey (Thirsti Thots 2 Tha Front) 3. Eric Andre (Slick Rick James) 4. Pork and Leek 5.

In Your Own Time For more information on  Years to Burn , the full bio is available  here .  Early praise for   Years to Burn :   “In incorporating more voices and sources of ideas, Years to Burn feels most of all like the work of a complete, cohesive and individual band — a group of old friends who’ve gathered together to sing in a single voice…The new set finds Sam Beam, John Convertino, Joey Burns and members of the extended Calexico and Iron & Wine casts at their loose-limbed best… They all sound comfortable, collaborating deep in the pocket, but they’re still exploring.”  -  NPR   “The warm voice of singer-songwriter Sam Beam (who performs as Iron & Wine) guides the album’s lead track “Father Mountain,” which features an airy acoustic progression and uplifting harmonies from Calexico’s Joey Burns.”  -  Rolling Stone   “Years to Burn proves that the time spent waiting on a second collaboration was worth it, but more meaningfully the album feels like the product of a cohesive unit rather than a tag team…Years to Burn rings with Beam’s soulful sobriety and Calexico’s gusty American Southwestern aesthetic, but the songwriting—again, primary credit goes to Beam—is the maypole around which the two bands braid their influences and proclivities. Unraveling one from the other is impossible.”   -  Paste   “Years to Burn, recorded with producer Matt Ross-Spang again marries vocalist and acoustic guitarist Sam Beam’s nimble lyricism with the incredible chops of Calexico nucleus Joey Burns and John Convertino. Together they make gorgeously sensual music”   - American Songwriter    “Years to Burn is a beautiful sounding recording and for fans of Calexico and Iron & Wine’s initial collaborative release, this is a nice treat after all these years.”  - Exclaim!

She really found her footing with her last release,  I’m Not Your Man,  and its exceptional, swaggering International hit “Boyfriend”, which boasts of seducing away a straight guy’s girlfriend.

{"title": "Watch METZ’s New Video For “Dry Up,” One Of The 12 Singles Collected On ‘Automat,’ Out Worldwide July 12th", "date": "WED, JUN 12, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "METZ will be on tour in May, June, and July. On July 12th, Sub Pop will release a chronological trip through the lesser known material of  METZ .  Automat  is a collection of non-album singles, B-sides, and rarities dating back to 2009, from the widely-adored and delightfully noisy 3-piece punk band. This will be the first time that this 12-song collection will be available on LP. The band has shared a new video for their song “ Dry Up.” “METZ have been making music together for over 10 years,” says the band’s frontman Alex Edkins. “It’s been a blur. We’ve very rarely allowed ourselves to look backward. We’ve been hyper-focused on always moving forward at breakneck speed, perpetually fixated on what’s next. The video for ‘Dry Up,’ as well as the  Automat   album,  is an attempt to pause, take a breath, look backward and take stock of our past. It’s intended to express how grateful we are to be able to do what we do. It’s a love letter to the incredible places we’ve traveled, the beautiful people we’ve met, to community, music, and friendship.” Consumers of the vinyl format of  Automat  will be rewarded with a bonus single that includes three additional tracks: a cover of Sparklehorse’s “Pig,” from a very limited 2012 Record Store Day split single originally released by Toronto’s Sonic Boom record shop; “I’m a Bug,” a cover of The Urinals’ art-punk classic, originally released on YouTube (not an actual record label) in 2014; and METZ’s previously unreleased rendition of Gary Numan’s “M.E.” All tracks on  Automat  have been lovingly remastered by Matthew Barnhart at Chicago Mastering Service. METZ are currently hard at work on their 4th full-length LP which will be released on Sub Pop when we are all damn good and ready.

It’s a door that we get to walk through and every now and then we get a glimpse behind the curtain. The people we meet become our friends and family. The imprint they leave becomes a part of us and our music, it’s a rare and beautiful thing. Now we get to share that experience with you.”  -  Ben Jaffe   A Tuba To Cuba  follows Ben Jaffe of New Orleans’ famed Preservation Hall Jazz Band as he seeks to fulfill his late father’s dream of retracing their musical roots to the shores of Cuba in search of the indigenous music that gave birth to New Orleans jazz.  A Tuba To Cuba celebrates the triumph of the human spirit expressed through the universal language of music and challenges us to resolve to build bridges, not walls. The film is available through Amazon Video, iTunes, DirecTV, Google Play, YouTube Movies and more. Check your local service provider for additional listings.   The New York Times  says of the film, “This joyous, wide-ranging account of a New Orleans jazz band’s 2015 visit to Cuba is crammed with fascinating facts and toe-tickling tunes.” And the LA Times offers this, “Jaunty, at times poetic chats and drop-ins with many Big Easy and Cuban jazz artists, discussion of their music’s African lineage (the Atlantic slave trade factored in), stirring examples of native instrumentation, and pulsating performances combine with colorful, travelogue-type shots (love those old Cuban theaters) and vivid archival footage to create a vibrant and joyous portrait.”   Preservation Hall Jazz Band Tour Dates: Jul 05 - Elkhorn, WI - Alpine Valley Music Theatre*  Jul 06 - Elkhorn, WI - Alpine Valley Music Theatre*  Jul 28 - Newport, RI - Newport Folk Festival Aug 02 - Happy Valley, OR - Pickathon Aug 03 - Happy Valley, OR - Pickathon  Aug 05 - Folsom, CA - Harris Center For The Arts Aug 06 - Folsom, CA - Harris Center For The Arts Aug 08 - San Francisco, CA - SFJAZZ Aug 09  - San Francisco, CA - SFJAZZ  Aug 10 - San Francisco, CA - SFJAZZ (7:00PM) Aug 10 - San Francisco, CA - SFJAZZ (9:30PM) Aug 11 - San Francisco, CA - SF Jazz Center - Miner Auditorium Aug 15 - Philadelphia, PA - Old Pool Farm Aug 16 - Philadelphia, PA - Old Pool Farm Aug 17 - Philadelphia, PA - Old Pool Farm Aug 18 - Philadelphia, PA - Old Pool Farm Aug 24 - Arrington, VA - Lockn’ Music Festival  Sep 20 - Louisville, KY - Bourbon & Beyond Festival Sep 21 - Franklin, TN - Pilgrimage Music Festival Sep 22 - Franklin, TN - Pilgrimage Music Festival Oct 22 - Ridgefield, CT - The Ridgefield Playhouse^ Oct 23 - Red Bank, NJ - Count Basie Center for the Arts^ Oct 24 - New York, NY – The Town Hall^ Oct 25 - Boston, MA - Berklee Performance Center^ Oct 26 - Portsmouth, NH - The Music Hall^ Oct 28 - Montreal, QC - Place des Arts – Theatre Maisoneuve^ Oct 29 - Toronto, ON - Roy Thomson Hall^ Oct 30 - Pittsburgh, PA - Byham Theater^ Nov 01 - Kent, OH - The Kent Stage^ Nov 02 - Goshen, IN - Goshen College Music Center^ Nov 04 - Chicago, IL - Thalia Hall^ Nov 05 - Saint Paul, MN - Fitzgerald Theater^ Nov 07 - Denver, CO - Paramount Theatre^ Nov 08 - Los Angeles, CA - ACE Hotel Nov 09 - Phoenix, AZ - Music Theater at MIM^ Nov 11 - Livermore, CA - Livermore Valley Performing Arts Center^ Nov 13 - Chico, CA - CSU Chico - Laxson Auditorium^ Nov 15 - Santa Rosa, CA - Luther Burbank Center for the Arts^ Nov 16 - Arcata, CA - John Van Duzer Theatre  ^ Nov 17 - Portland, OR - Revolution Hall^ Nov 18 - Seattle, WA - Benaroya Hall – Taper Auditorium^ Nov 20 - Santa Cruz, CA - Rio Theatre^ Nov 21 - Santa Barbara, CA - UCSB Campbell Hall^ Nov 22 - San Diego, CA - Wonderfront Music Festival Nov 29 - Baltimore, MD - Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall Nov 30 - Baltimore, MD - Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall Dec 01 - Baltimore, MD - Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall *with Dave Matthews Band ^with Yusa"},
{"title": "Shannon Lay to release August, her Sub Pop debut worldwide on August 23rd", "date": "TUE, JUN 4, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "Transcendent folk-pop artist Shannon Lay will release  August , her Sub Pop debut, on CD/LP/DL/CS worldwide on August 23rd. You can now watch the official video for  “Nowhere,”  the album’s lead single, directed by Lay and Chris Slater. She says of the song and visual, “I want this song to emphasize the importance of enjoying the journey. The video is moments of in between travel footage, different settings around my home, singing in the bounty of spring. There is so much power in presence, enjoy every moment, savor every second. Cherish the memories made along the way and appreciate how they change and shape you.” The title  August  refers to the month in 2017 when Lay quit her day job and fully gave herself over to music. This was her liberation as an artist, and the album is devoted to paying that forward to her listeners. “It’s a thank you to the universe,” says the Los Angeles artist. Exquisitely uplifting,  August  doubles as an aural baptism renewing her purpose for making music. “I always picture music as this river. Everyone’s throwing things into this river, it’s a place you can go to and feed off of that energy,” she says, “and feel nourished by the fact that so many people are feeling what you’re feeling. It’s this beautiful exchange.”  You can listen to her cover of the classic Karen Dalton track “Something On Your Mind”  here . August  is now available for preorder from Sub Pop. LP preorders of the album through  megamart.subpop.com  and select independent retailers in North America, UK, and Europe will receive the limited Loser edition on orange vinyl (North America) and Sun Yellow vinyl (UK/EU) while supplies last. As previously reported, Shannon Lay will be a member of Ty Segall’s Freedom Band for his upcoming full album residencies in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, London, Berlin, and Haarlem (See  Pitchfork’s news story April 24th ).

{"title": "Tacocat Announce 2019 UK Tour Dates Supporting New Album ‘This Mess is a Place’", "date": "THU, MAY 30, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "[ Photo Credit: Helen Moga ]  After recently releasing their new album  ’ This Mess Is a Place ’ , Seattle pop-punk four piece  Tacocat  have just announced a UK tour for this August with shows in Glasgow, Manchester, Cardiff, London & Brighton. ICYMI, you can see the video for album standout track  “New World”   now   here . When Seattle band Tacocat—vocalist Emily Nokes, bassist Bree McKenna, guitarist Eric Randall, and drummer Lelah Maupin—first started in 2007, the world they were responding to was vastly different from the current Seattle scene of diverse voices they’ve helped foster. It was a world of house shows, booking DIY tours on MySpace, and writing funny, deliriously catchy feminist pop-punk songs when feminism was the quickest way to alienate yourself from the then-en vogue garage-rock bros. Their lyrical honesty, humor, and hit-making sensibilities have built the band a fiercely devoted fanbase over the years, one that has followed them from basements to dive bars to sold-out shows at the Showbox. Every step along the way has been a seamless progression—from silly songs about Tonya Harding and psychic cats to calling out catcallers and poking fun at entitled weekend-warrior tech jerks on their last two records on Hardly Art, 2014’s  NVM  and 2016’s  Lost Time .   This Mess Is a Place , Tacocat’s fourth full-length and first  on Sub Pop,  finds the band waking up the morning after the 2016 election and figuring out how to respond to a new reality where evil isn’t hiding under the surface at all—it’s front and center, with new tragedies and civil rights assaults filling up the scroll of the newsfeed every day. See Tacocat live in the UK: 25 Aug – Glasgow, Scotland – Broadcast 27 Aug – Manchester, England – Gullivers 28 Aug – Cardiff, Wales – Clwb Ifor Bach 29 Aug – London, England – MOTH Club 30 Aug – Brighton, England – The Hope & Ruin 31 Aug – Paris, France – Supersonic 01 Sep – Brussels, Belgium – Botanique 03 Sep – Nijmegen, Netherlands – Merleyn 04 Sep – Groningen, Netherlands – Vera 05 Sep – Amsterdam, Netherlands – Paradiso 06 Sep – Eindhoven, Netherlands – Alstadt 07 Sep – Rotterdam, Netherlands – Rotown 09 Sep – Nurenburg, Germany – Kantine 10 Sep – Berlin, Germany – Marie Antoinette 11 Sep – Hamburg, Germany – Goldener Salon (Hafenklang) 13 Sep – Copenhagen, Denmark – Loppen 14 Sep – Oslo, Norway – Revolver 15 Sep – Stockholm, Sweden – Obaren Ticket links are  here ."},

{"title": "Marika Hackman To Release ‘Any Human Friend’ On August 9th; Shares Official Video For “i’m not where you are”", "date": "WED, MAY 22, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "Announces North American tour dates for 2019. Rock provocateur  Marika Hackman   will release her highly anticipated new album  Any Human Friend   on 9th August via Sub Pop in North and South America and AMF Records for the rest of the world. Marika also unveils her slap-in-the-face,  Will Hooper -directed (IDLES, APRE) video for current single“i’m not where you are.” The FADER  had this to say of the video, “Hackman is preparing to release  Any Human Friend , the follow up to  I’m Not Your Man  and, if its lead single “i’m not where you are” is anything to go by, a record just as brazen as its predecessor. “i’m not where you are” is one of Hackman’s most darkly-toned tracks yet: an ode to emotional unavailability delivered with Hackman’s typically smooth hypnotic, vocals. “I’ve been trying to find the point in human contact,” Hackman sings over crunchy guitars and bright synths, before shrugging the whole thing off entirely: “I get bored like that.” (see  video premiere May 21st ).” Marika Hackman Tour Dates Marika Hackman international tour schedule in support of  Any Human Friend  begins for 2019 spans September 21st in Bristol, UK at Thekla and ends November 6th in West Hollywood, CA at The Roxy Theatre.

Now available for preorder from Sub Pop:  LP preorders through  megamart.subpop.com  and  select independent retailers in North America  will receive the limited Loser edition on Salmon-colored vinyl (while supplies last).  There will also be a new t-shirt design available. Cover art photography by  Joost Vandebrug , inspired by  Rineke Dijkstra  (see “More on…” below). Any Human Friend Tracklisting:   1. wanderlust 2. the one 3. all night 4. blow 5. i’m not where you are 6. send my love 7. hand solo 8. conventional ride 9. come undone 10. hold on 11. any human friend More on Marika Hackman’s  Any Human Friend : “hand solo,” “blow,” “conventional ride”—these are just a few of the cheeky offerings off  Any Human Friend,  the new album from rock provocateur Marika Hackman. “This whole record is me diving into myself and peeling back the skin further and further, exposing myself in quite a big way. It can be quite sexual,” Hackman says. “It’s blunt, but not offensive. It’s mischievous.” There’s also depth to her carnal knowledge:  Any Human Friend  (August 9th from Sub Pop Records in North and South America and AMF for the rest of the world) is ultimately about how, as she puts it, “We all have this lightness and darkness in us.”  Hackman lifted the album’s title from a documentary about four-year-olds interacting with dementia patients in senior homes. At one point, two little girls confer about their experience there, with one musing on how it’s great to make “any human friend,” whether old or young. “When she said that it really touched a nerve in me,” says the London-based musician. “It’s that childlike view where we really accept people, are comfortable with their differences.”  Such introspection has earned Hackman her name. Her folkie 2015 debut,  We Slept at Last , was heralded for being nuanced and atmospheric. She really found her footing with her last release,  I’m Not Your Man —which earned raves from  The Guardian, Stereogum , and  Pitchfork —and its sybaritic, swaggering hit “Boyfriend,” which boasts of seducing away a straight guy’s girlfriend. “Her tactile lyrics keep the songs melodically strong and full of surprises,” remarked Pitchfork . We’ll say!  “I’m a hopeless romantic,” she explains. “I search for love and sexual experience, but also I’m terrified by it.” Hackman is a  Rid of Me -era PJ Harvey for the inclusive generation: unbounded by musical genre, a preternatural lyricist and tunesmith who isn’t afraid to go there. (Even her cover art, which finds Hackman nearly nude while cradling a baby pig, is a nod to Dutch photographer  Rineke Dijkstra’s  unfiltered photos of mothers just after they gave birth.) To that end, “hand solo” extorts the virtues of masturbation and  features Hackman’s favorite line, “Under patriarchal law, I’m going to die a virgin.” The song “blow” paints a picture of social excess. And “conventional ride” thumbs its nose at heterosexual sex through “the trope a lot of gay women experience: sleeping with someone, then it becomes apparent you’re kind of an experiment.” With  Any Human Friend , boundaries are no longer an issue for her. “I sent ‘all night’ to my parents and they were quite shocked,” she says of the paean to the flesh, dressed as a sweetly harmonic track. “Why does it sound shocking coming out of my mouth? Women have sex with each other, and it seems to me we aren’t as freely allowed to discuss that as men are. But at no point am I disrespecting the women I’m having sex with. It can be fucking sexy without banging people over the head with a frying pan. It’s sexy sex.” Sharing intimacies with her parents sorta makes sense when you consider she wrote “the one”—a portrait of the artist amid identity crisis—and several other songs in her bedroom at their house, where she crashed after a painful break-up with a longtime girlfriend. “‘send my love’ is a proper breakup song,” she says of the levitating, string-laden track. “I actually wrote that in a moment of grief. It’s a strange take on it because I’m imagining myself as my ex-girlfriend.” She penned its companion track, “i’m not where you are,” a melodic earworm about emotional detachment from relationships, roughly six months later. “I think because my life was flipped upside down, it was taking me longer to write,” she says. “This was definitely the hardest process I’ve gone through to make a record.” She wrote the album over a year, recording a few songs at a time with co-producer David Wrench (Frank Ocean, The xx). “I stopped being able to sleep properly,” she says. “I was waking up in the middle of the night to write songs.” But the longer recording process also meant that Hackman had the time to experiment in the studio, especially with electronic songs. She was inspired by Wrench’s vast synth collection, many of which she used throughout  Any Human Friend  (“the synths give the album a nice shine”), notably on “hold on,” a deep dive into ennui expressed as ethereal R&B. She also switched up drum rhythms and wrote songs on the bass, such as the upbeat, idiosyncratic “come undone” (working name: “Funky Little Thang”). Hackman bookends  Any Human Friend  with some of her most unexpected musical turns. The first song she wrote, “the one” (technically its second track), is “probably the poppiest song I’ve ever written,” she says. “It’s about that weird feeling of starting the process again from scratch.” To that end, it features a riot grrrl Greek chorus hurling such insults at her as, “You’re such an attention whore!” The title track closes out the album and explores how, “when we’re interacting with people, it’s like holding a mirror up to yourself.” It’s a weightless coda that’s jazz-like in its layering of rhythmic sounds as if you’re leisurely sorting through Hackman’s headspace. “The drive to do all this is all just about trying to work out what the fuck is in my brain,” she says, laughing. The dragon she’s chasing is a rarified peace that materializes after properly tortured herself. “I really did have a good time working on this album,” she says, reassuringly. “It’s just emotionally draining to write music and constantly tap into your psyche. No musician is writing music for themselves to listen to. It’s a dialogue, a conversation, a connection. I’m creating something for people to react to.”"},

{"title": "Watch the Delightful New METZ Video for “Pure Auto,” One of the 12 Singles Collected on ‘Automat,’ out Worldwide July 12th", "date": "THU, MAY 16, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "METZ will be on tour in May, June and July of this year. METZ , our own widely-adored and delightfully noisy 3-piece punk band from Toronto, released their Sub Pop self-titled debut in 2012 and, in the time since, have cemented their reputation as one of the planet’s most exhilarating live acts and trusted providers of bombastic outsider rock. The band is made up of Alex Edkins, Hayden Menzies, and Chris Slorach.  Automat  is a collection of METZ non-album singles, B-sides, and rarities dating back to 2009, available  here  on LP for the first time, and including the band’s long out-of-print early (pre-Sub Pop) recordings. A chronological trip through the lesser known material of METZ,  Automat  will be released worldwide on Sub Pop July 12, 2019.   The band’s Alex Edkins shares, “The idea to release  Automat  came after realizing our early 7” singles were being sold online for upwards of $60 bucks a pop. We wanted to make those songs available and affordable to anyone who might want them in the physical format. What started as reissuing a couple of 45s, quickly morphed into an entire LP, compiling rarities, demos and alternate takes from over the years.”     “‘Pure Auto’ is METZ at our most tongue in cheek,” says Edkins. “There are many winks and many nods (autonomy, me, me, me, me, me, for example) but ultimately it’s about being a control freak;  fighting the urge to constantly steer the ship. Originally released as the B-side to the ‘Eraser’ 7” it has never been played live, but for some reason still manages to be one of our collective favorites. It was written and recorded very quickly after completing the  II  album sessions and came out of a surge of creativity/excitement/relief following a particularly intense and time-consuming album.   You can watch the new video for “Pure Auto” by Montreal’s Scorpion Dagger by clicking here and also  here .”   Consumers of the vinyl format of  Automat  will be rewarded with a bonus single that includes three additional tracks: a cover of Sparklehorse’s “Pig,” from a very limited 2012 Record Store Day split single originally released by Toronto’s Sonic Boom record shop; “I’m a Bug,” a cover of The Urinals’ art-punk classic, originally released on YouTube (not an actual record label) in 2014; and METZ’s previously unreleased rendition of Gary Numan’s “M.E.” METZ are currently hard at work on their 4th full-length LP which will be released on Sub Pop when we are all damn good and ready.   All tracks on  Automat  have been lovingly remastered by Matthew Barnhart at Chicago Mastering Service.

[ Photo Credit:   Denee Segall ] Thrilled to announce that Sub Pop has signed a worldwide recording deal with transcendent folk-pop artist  Shannon Lay .  Pitchfork  described her 2017 release  Living Water  as “a work of plainspoken mysticism that goes to the small, bright truth of things, showcasing her unusual songwriting and quietly commanding voice.” To celebrate this union, Lay has shared a cover of the classic Karen Dalton song “Something On Your Mind.” “This song means a lot to me,” says Lay. “The version that Karen Dalton does is a gorgeous piece of wisdom. I wanted to cover it because I believe in the message with all my heart. Life is going to knock you down and lift you up and you’ll never experience any of it unless you try. I love the idea of spreading that spirit further. If there’s something on your mind, let it out. Try even if there’s a possibility you’ll fail, you might learn something amazing about yourself.” You can listen to Shannon Lay’s cover of “Something On Your Mind”  here . Shannon Lay will join as a member of Ty Segall’s Freedom Band for his upcoming Full album residencies in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, London, Berlin, and Haarlem. See   Pitchfork’s  news story from April 24th. Following these shows, Shannon will start an 18-date North American run opening for Mikal Cronin.

You can preorder both albums now through  Sub Pop Mega Mart  and select independent retailers in  North America , UK and Europe. Both albums are also available digitally now from Sub Pop.  So It Is  was originally released in 2017, and finds the classic Preservation Hall Jazz Band sound invigorated by a number of fresh influences, not  least  among them  the band’s 2015 life-changing trip to Cuba. A visit to the island, so integral to the evolution of jazz and New Orleans culture in general, had long been in the works when President Obama’s diplomatic opening suddenly allowed for a more extensive journey than had originally seemed possible. Producer David Sitek, a founder of art rock innovators TV on the Radio who has helmed projects by Kelis, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Santigold among others, offered both a keen modern perspective and a profound respect for the band’s storied history.  So It Is Tracklisting 1. So It Is 2. Santiago 3. Innocence 4. La Malanga 5. Convergence 6. One Hundred Fires 7. Mad   Released in 2013,  That’s It!  is an eclectic album that draws on the collective experience of players nurtured in the New Orleans tradition but determined to build something fresh and exciting on that foundation. It marks an important milestone in PHJB Creative Director Ben Jaffe’s crusade to carry forward the Hall’s original mission while making it relevant to today’s audiences. For his part, co-producer Jim James is convinced that the PHJB has a future as vibrant as its past: “The music will speak forever,” he says. “Will people stop listening to Beethoven? Will people stop listening to Bob Dylan? Will people stop listening to the Preservation Hall Jazz Band?” That’s It! Tracklisting 1. That’s It! 2. Dear Lord (Give Me The Strength) 3. Come With Me  4.

Herrington and Danny Clinch. The song is available now worldwide on all DSPs from  Sub Pop .   “A Tuba To Cuba” follows Ben Jaffe of New Orleans’ famed Preservation Hall Jazz Band as he seeks to fulfill his late father’s dream of retracing their musical roots to the shores of Cuba in search of the indigenous music that gave birth to New Orleans jazz. “A Tuba To Cuba” celebrates the triumph of the human spirit expressed through the universal language of music and challenges us to resolve to build bridges, not walls. The film is available through Amazon Video, iTunes, DirecTV, Google Play, YouTube Movies and more. Check your local service provider for additional listings.   The New York Times  says of the film, “This joyous, wide-ranging account of a New Orleans jazz band’s 2015 visit to Cuba is crammed with fascinating facts and toe-tickling tunes.” And the  LA Times  offers this, “Jaunty, at times poetic chats and drop-ins with many Big Easy and Cuban jazz artists, discussion of their music’s African lineage (the Atlantic slave trade factored in), stirring examples of native instrumentation, and pulsating performances combine with colorful, travelogue-type shots (love those old Cuban theaters) and vivid archival footage to create a vibrant and joyous portrait.”"},

Yuno  has directed an official video for his reworked single “ Sunlight ,” which is now available in its new form through all DSPs today via Sub Pop.   The “Sunlight” single is an ode to joy, and it’s collage-like visual follows Yuno spending time with friends and creating music. He says of the video, “This song is about longing to be with someone you care about. I just started touring last year, and I got to meet a lot of people in person that I’ve been friends with for years. I was also far away from people I care about. I wrote this song a long time ago, but I wanted to update it and capture the feeling of how relevant it is in my life right now.” The “Sunlight” rework was co-produced by Yuno and producer Lars Stalfors (Lil Peep, HEALTH, Bob Moses, Matt and Kim). Yuno’s “Sunlight” along with his breakout single, “No Going Back,” are currently featured in the hit Netflix film,  The Perfect Date (see  Refinery 29  April 24th ).       Yuno’s  Moodie , his first-ever collection of songs, is available now worldwide  through Sub Pop .  Moodie  was written, performed, and produced by Yuno.   What people are saying about Yuno: “An early entry into the race for song of the summer.” [“No Going Back”] -   NPR Music   “‘No Going Back” insists what we’re all thinking for the new pop wunderkind: Only forward.” [“No Going Back”, Best New Track] - Pitchfork   “A masterfully written song, but instead of being polished to a bore, it feels handmade, with a fuzzy guitar solo, meaty bass, and a euphoric bounce.”  [“No Going Back”] -  Pigeons & Planes   “Yuno’s lithe voice floats amidst the cheerful soundscape, bouncing off the plucky piano keys… the brand of sunny pop displayed on ‘No Going Back’ should earn him his own cult fanbase.” -  Impose   “It’s light and breezy indie-pop, with warm and bouncy synth-lines softly coloured overck with warm piano melodies and guitar solos. His vocals – fitting beautifully into the current psychedelic renaissance spearheaded by the likes of Tame Impala and Washed Out – pour out an infectious melody that’s simultaneously great fun and inflected with melancholy.”  [“No Going Back”] -  Indie Shuffle   “Bouncy and bright…” [“No Going Back”] -  Gorilla Vs. Bear.   “Charming us all with its buoyant pop flair and instrumentals that sound as if they were seemingly dipped in sunshine, “No Going Back” signals Yuno’s return in a way that’s almost impossible to shake. “No Going Back” is as promising as it is optimistic.”  [“No Going Back”] -  The Grey Estates “Drifting digital pop casting a bittersweet spell.”  [“No Going Back”] - CLASH"},

I arrived at our rental house the day before everyone else and was happy to find a piano, old pump organ and guitar to do some writing. I was up late and came up with a tune that would bridge both bands’ worlds. I started with a drone in F# and was curious as to where it would take me.”   Calexico and Iron & Wine  previously shared the lead single off of the album called “ Father Mountain ”.

Now Watch Their Official Video For “Read My Mind”", "date": "FRI, APR 26, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever  have delivered an intense new video for “Read My Mind” from their “In the Capital” b/w ‘Read My Mind” 7” single out today on Sub Pop.   The sobering visual was directed by Warwick Baker and edited by Bill Irving. The band had this to say, “We gave the song to our close friend Baker, a respected Australian photographer, to interpret visually.”   And Baker elaborates, “I hoped to observe and document the spectacle of the rodeo, focusing on the performers rather than the audience. Being a vegetarian I found the event confronting, but wanted to document the theater and ritual of the rodeo without glorifying or condemning it.”   Rolling Blackouts C.F’s North American shows in support of  Hope Downs  and “In the Capital” / “Read My Mind” single begin May 26th in Boston for Boston Calling and end June 13th in Manchester, TN at Bonnaroo. The group’s European and the UK run begins July 3rd at in Roskilde, DK’s Roskilde Festival and ends July 27th in Thirsk, UK at the Deer Shed Festival. Additional international festival highlights for the May-July timeframe include Governors Ball (May 31st), Lattitude Festival (May 31st), Down the Rabbit Hole (July 5th), and Mad Cool Festival (July 12th).   May 03 - Castlemaine, AU - Theatre Royal May 04 - Melbourne, AU - Croxton May 10 - Sydney, AU - Manning Bar May 26 - Boston, MA - Boston Calling May 28 - Philadelphia, PA - Underground Arts May 29 - Washington, DC - U Street Music Hall May 31 - New York, NY - Governors Ball (early) May 31 - Brooklyn, NY - Warsaw (late) Jun. 02 - Toronto, ON - The Mod Club Jun. 04 - Chicago, IL - Thalia Hall Jun. 06 - Seattle, WA - The Crocodile Jun. 07 - Vancouver, BC - Rickshaw Theatre Jun. 08 - Portland, OR - Doug Fir Lounge Jun. 10 - San Francisco, CA - Great American Music Hall Jun. 11 - Los Angeles, CA - The Lodge Room Jun. 13 - Manchester, TN - Bonnaroo Jul. 03 - Roskilde, DK - Roskilde Festival Jul. 05 - Ewijk, NL - Down the Rabbit Hole Festival Jul. 07 - Paris, FR - Le Point Ephémère Jul. 09 - Liverpool, UK - Invisible Wind Factory Jul. 11 - Dublin, IE - The Iveagh Gardens Jul. 12 - Madrid, ES - Mad Cool Festival Jul. 13 - Lisbon, PT - NOS Alive Jul. 15 - Glasgow, UK - St. Luke’s Jul. 16 - Sheffield, UK - The Leadmill Jul. 18 - Cardiff, UK - Clwb Ifor Bach Jul. 19 - Bedford, UK - Esquires Jul. 21 - Suffolk, UK - Latitude Festival Jul. 22 - Birmingham, UK - Mama Roux’s Jul. 23 - Reading, UK - Sub89 Jul. 25 - Nyon, CH - Paleo Nyon Festival Jul. 27 - Thirsk, UK - Deer Shed Festival [ Photo Credit: Pooneh Ghana ]   What people are saying about Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever: “ Hope Downs  more than delivers on the promise of the Melbourne quintet’s two early EPs, doubling down on the melancholy pop it forged on 2015’s  Talk Tight  and last year’s  The French Press  while also polishing its sound.” - [ Hope Downs , Grade: A-] -  The AV Club   “It’s entirely addictive–one fix and you’re hooked” [ Hope Downs, 9/10] -  Uncut   “Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever have more tricks up their sleeves, it seems. For a debut, though, a couple tricks are enough, especially when you’ve already mastered them. [ Hope Downs,  8.9/10] - PASTE   “A three-guitar front line — plucked, sustained and most often busily strummed — gives this Australian band its brisk pacing. Topped with semi-spoken, Dylan-tinged vocals and lyrics that switch between candor and drollery, its music is like folk-rock wrapped around a post-punk armature.” [SXSW Review] -  NY Times   “Sophisticated and subversive in equal measure, their staccato sing-alongs come on pristine and precise, then unspool in surprising directions as decorum gives way to abandon.” [ Hope Downs,  8.1/10] -  Pitchfork   “Every amp tone on this album is just sweet enough, every jangling rhythm hits exactly where it should. Rolling Blackouts are playing an old game, but they’re damned good at it.” [ Hope Downs,  4/5] -   Rolling Stone   “Even at their most fervent, the characters of  Hope Downs  remain soaked in sun, able to convince themselves that one great night could be enough to set them straight again. At about 35 minutes, Hope Downs is a brief vacation, and so are many of its songs.” [ Hope Downs,  4/5] -  SPIN"},
{"title": "Kyle Craft & Showboat Honey Share Official Video For “2 Ugly 4 NY” From Their Forthcoming Album ‘Showboat Honey’", "date": "THU, APR 25, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "Watch  Kyle Craft  & Showboat Honey’s official video for lead single “2 Ugly 4 NY” from  Showboat Honey , their forthcoming new album, available worldwide July 12th, 2019 from Sub Pop. The video is directed by Eleanor Petry, and stars bandleader Craft as Hobo Grimm, a skeleton-faced busker. He says of the video, “Eleanor and I were aiming to snag that “day in the life” feel, following old Hobo Grim around downtown tryin’ to make the illusive busker’s dollar and then heading off into the night to blow it.” Showboat Honey  was recorded and produced by Kyle Craft, Kevin Clark, and Billy Slater at their own Moonbase Studios in Portland over 2018. The album was mixed by Trevor Spencer (Father John Misty) and mastered by April Golden at Golden Mastering. Showboat Honey  is now available for preorder through  Sub Pop Mega Mart .  Preorders of the LP through megamart.subpop.com and  select independent retailers in North America , the UK and Europe will receive the limited Loser edition on a clear blue translucent mix with spots red hi-melt (while supplies last).   There will also be a new T-shirt design available.  Showboat Honey Tracklisting:   1. Broken Mirror Pose 2. O! Lucky Hand 3. 2 Ugly 4 NY 4. Blackhole/Joyride 5. Bed of Needles #2 6. Deathwish Blue 7. Blood in the Water 8. Buzzkill Caterwaul 9. Sunday Driver 10. Johnny (Free & Easy) 11. She’s Lily Riptide [ Photo Credit: Peter Karaviaw ] About  Showboat Honey : There is this curious equilibrium to existence: In order to create balance, the universe must giveth, and the universe must taketh. Kyle Craft, along with his now solidified backing band dubbed Showboat Honey, know this all too well. And this is why their self-titled album, the contemplative yet restless  Showboat Honey  (Sub Pop Records, July 12th, 2019) reflects that sturm und drang. “This is basically an album centered around bad luck and good fortune hitting at the same time,” Craft explains “Then, out of nowhere, I find love. Everything went to shit except that. I guess that’s how life works.”    No track better captures this duality than the sweeping “Sunday Driver,” about sticking to your guns, despite a universe of blowback. “At this point, you get baptized by certain fires and start to walk with the dead a little bit, like nothing can harm you anymore,” says the Portland-based musician. “That’s what self-love sounds like to me, as aggressive as that sounds.”   The sticky-sweet title of the album is lifted from the brightly choral “Buzzkill Caterwaul” (“Once you were the showboat honey/ But your ship sailed out”). “I wanted to make something that sounded like a raucous collision of Leon Russell and Patti Smith,” he says, “But ‘Buzzkill Caterwaul’ was the only tune that ended up showcasing that vision.”   Though aesthetics veer from song to song,  Showboat Honey ’s steadfast formula remains the same. Drummer Haven Mutlz holds down the machine with a ’60s/’70s fast-molasses groove that locks in with the slinky rolling bass of Billy Slater. When Kevin Clark isn’t bouncing across the piano, his mellotron strings swell in and out of frame. Jack of all trades Ben Steinmetz’s organ parts well up from the deep of the songs, while lead guitarist Jeremy Kale’s solos rip through them like electricity. On top of it all, sits the tongue-in-cheek phantasmagoria created by Craft’s lyrics.     Lyrically, perspectives shift to imbue life into a cast of intriguing, mysterious characters, à la Bob Dylan. (“There is not a single thing in my life that has affected me more than the first time I heard Dylan,” says Craft. “It immediately changed my life.”) “Johnny (Free & Easy)” is seemingly about a date gone awry at a swinger’s party in the Hollywood Hills. And the twangy pop of “O! Lucky Hand” appears to shadow a poor sod desperate to elude a hex. Its antidote is the stunning, cinematic “Deathwish Blue,” which sounds like a deep cut from the book of John Lennon, about the lovesick salvation found in his bride to be, Lydia.    If that’s not head-trippy enough, the carefree sing-along “2 Ugly 4 NY” features a lyrical reference to a previous incarnation of Craft. Its lyrics—“Don’t wanna see Death strum for cash downtown/ Or the look on his face when the change hits the case on the ground”—call out his early days in Portland when he went by the moniker of Hobo Grim. Busking downtown, he’d cover country tunes while dressed as the Grim Reaper so as to conceal his true identity.     Craft started writing about as soon as he could play the guitar at the age of 15. He grew up in the isolated Mississippi River town of Vidalia, Louisiana where his chops weren’t honed in a woodshed, but rather an old, dingy meat freezer that was out of commission.  When asked about the first song he’d ever written, he laughs, saying it was an “angsty-rock tune” and “a rare bird of how bad a song could be.”         After years of touring, two LPs with Sub Pop Records, and solidifying the band, he’s since grown into a prodigious songwriter, to say the least. The band recorded  Showboat Honey— co-produced by Craft, Clark, and Slater—at their own Moonbase Studios in Portland over 2018. “We approached this record differently for sure,” Craft says. “I’d make a demo, and after putting the songs together, shoot it to the band for ideas.” Tracks such as “Broken Mirror Pose” ended up being highly collaborative, while others settled into Craft’s original vision. “Deathwish Blue,” for instance, was tracked in a similar fashion to his solo debut,  Dolls of Highland , with Craft tracking every instrument by himself.     Kyle and the members of Showboat Honey worked at such a feverish wine-fueled pace that they actually ended up with two completely different albums. But at the end of the day, they decided to combine the two into what is now  Showboat Honey, a moonstruck rock ’n’ roll record teeming with reckless abandon.        “We thought we had the album done at one point. But at the last minute, I was like, ‘Shit, this isn’t the album. This isn’t it,’” Kyle says. “It was just a gut feeling. I’m glad for that because I feel like I ended up writing some of the best songs I’ve ever written.”"},

{"title": "Marika Hackman Releases New Single “i’m not where you are” From Her Forthcoming New Album", "date": "WED, APR 24, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "Rock provocateur  Marika Hackman  returns with melodic earworm  “i’m not where you are”  which shows off a sharper and more liberated sound than ever before. The track was co-produced by Marika and David Wrench (Frank Ocean, The xx, Let’s Eat Grandma), and is available now digitally from Sub Pop (in North and South America) and AMF Records (for the rest of the world)  Listen now on  YouTube  +  Spotify  +  Apple Music . [ Single Cover Art Credit: Joost Vandebrug ] “i’m not where you are” “is about breaking up with people, or self-sabotaging relationships” Marika explains. “That feeling of not trusting one’s emotions because you can’t seem to get to the same place as the other person.  On the surface, it seems like an arrogant everybody falls in love with me” kind of song but its actually incredibly lonely, introspective and self-deprecating”    “i’m not where you are” fits into a wider narrative, in which the process of writing was cathartic and - as the best songwriters do - she has strengthened her own voice through the process, exploring herself and emerging with a widescreen, heavy-hitting new sound.   Marika has deployed synthesizers that recall the off-kilter, oddball hits of OMD or New Order and places them at the heart of “i’m not where you are.” For all the urgency of the backing music, Marika’s natural delivery and sensuous tone offers a dreamlike quality to the proceedings and allows her to look within to find answers that make sense outside.   Hackman is a  Rid of Me -era PJ Harvey for the inclusive generation: unbounded by musical genre, a preternatural lyricist and tunesmith who isn’t afraid to go there. Hackman’s 2015 debut,  We Slept at Last , was heralded for being nuanced and atmospheric. She really found her footing with her last release,  I’m Not Your Man —which earned raves from  The Guardian ,  Stereogum , and  Pitchfork —and its sybaritic, swaggering hit “Boyfriend,” which boasts of seducing away a straight guy’s girlfriend. Marika’s new sound sees her dive into herself, peeling back the skin further and further, exposing herself in a big way, creating something for people to react to.   Having recently teased new music at the BBC 6  Music festival, Marika is gearing up to an exciting year of touring. More news to come. [ Photo Credit: Joost Vandebrug ]   What people have said about Marika Hackman: “Her tactile lyrics keep the songs melodically strong and full of surprises…As a writer, Hackman may owe a bit to PJ Harvey, but  I’m Not Your Man  is the proper arrival of a bold young British force.” [ I’m Not Your Man ] -  Pitchfork   “Hackman’s greatest weapon is her words, and she uses her dark wit to lure you in while conveying strong messages about her life and society.” [ I’m Not Your Man ] -   Stereogum   “A bolder, more upfront record than her first, no longer couching her sexuality in metaphors about nature…” [ I’m Not Your Man ] -   NPR Music   “Marika Hackman’s latest evolution is a triumph that finds equilibrium amid both wit and heart.” [ I’m Not Your Man ] -   All Music"},

{"title": "The 2019 Loser Scholarship Winners!", "date": "FRI, APR 12, 2019 at 900 AM", "preview": "After reading through great, heaping stacks of wonderfully inspirational applications, we here at the Really Very Official Sub Pop Records  Scholarship  Committee have chosen three exceptionally qualified student winners for our 2019 Sub Pop Loser  Scholarship . Ester - graduating from  David Douglas High School  in Portland - is our first place Loser winner this year. We were and are blown away by Ester’s talents and hereby recognize her as more than worthy of the $7,000  scholarship . As a Russian refugee immigrant, Ester and her family faced many hardships, but rather than let these difficulties drag her down, Ester found ways to use challenges in her life as inspiration. An incredible photo realist painter, Ester has earned one of the top student artist awards in the country for her  Immigrant Experience  art show and “I, America’s Poster Child,” series of paintings. Ester took time to interview her subjects firsthand to identify some of the troubling social constructs that immigrant youth in her community face. Through her art, Ester hopes to raise awareness of the difficult cultural circumstances many immigrant youth deal with and change some of their circumstances for the better. On top of being an incredible painter Ester also does film work, sculpture, and performance art. It is hard to believe Ester didn’t start art classes until high school because she is so incredibly talented! We love that Ester wants to use her ongoing arts education to help impoverished and immigrant artists better their lives and we are glad to be able to help further those goals in some small way. Alright, Ester! Frankie - graduating from Seattle’s Nova High School - has done 600 volunteer hours at the Vera Project, an all-ages music and arts space in Seattle, as an audio engineer supporting local and national music acts. We loved Frankie’s application describing the mental hurdles she has had to overcome to persevere as a female doing live sound for artists. As a student in the Vera audio design program, Frankie started from the bottom and worked her way up through hard work and dedication. While taking in everything that her mentors at Vera had to teach about sound design and the professional attitude required to work with artists, Frankie was able to gain confidence in her skills as an engineer. As the only female sound engineer in her class, Frankie fought through deeply engrained societal expectations to become a professional, paid sound engineer at the age of 17. How cool is that?! Outside of Vera, Frankie also helped to revive the band program at her high school, which helped to empower many dormant but talented musicians in her orbit. Frankie hopes to further pursue professional audio engineering and wants to set an example that might help to bring other women and femmes into the audio field. Given all of this information, we’re proud to name Frankie our $5,000 Sub Pop Loser  Scholarship  winner! Lillian - graduating from St. Helens High School - is the winner of our $3,000 Sub Pop Loser  Scholarship . Lillian is the first human interested in robotics we’ve had apply for the  scholarship  and her application was a stunner. Her animation reel, drawings, paintings, the inspiration she drew from her robotics team, and her understanding that being a Loser means, “ …having to define your own purpose when none of the preexisting options will fit,” really set Lillian apart from the other applicants. A succinct but very well-written essay with a keen awareness of what it means to be a Sub Pop Loser helped Lillian stand out from the crowd. We are happy to know that someone in St. Helens is an art program recruit, art show curator, has taken every art class possible, is out to create her own path, is inspired by other young artists, and helps artists thrive in her local community. Lillian tells us she’ll be attending OSU as a double major in robotics and art. We are deeply into it, Lillian. Go get ‘em! And, those are our 2019 Sub Pop Loser  Scholarship  winners – ta-da! Thanks to everyone who applied, we loved all of your submissions! You’re an incredibly talented, inspiring bunch of people, and these were not easy decisions. We’re certain that you will all go on to blow us away with your future accomplishments."},

New Singles Club Tracks “Delicacy” And “I Don’t Dance” Out Now In DSPs", "date": "FRI, APR 12, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "Support dates with Foals and Preoccupations Beginning April 12- April 30th with additional headline dates throughout May  [ Photo Credit:  Emily Frobos ] We are thrilled to share that Sub Pop has signed a worldwide recording deal with angular Atlantans,  Omni . The band is currently working on their third album, after two acclaimed LPs of tightly wound, tuneful & cerebral, post punk-pop on the highly regarded, Trouble in Mind Records.  Omni has contributed two new tracks to the latest edition of the iconic  Sub Pop Singles Club  series. You can now stream “Delicacy” and “I Don’t Dance” via all digital service providers, including  YouTube ,  Spotify  and  Apple Music .  Frontman for the band, Philip Frobos says “Delicacy” was one of the first songs we wrote after a couple of years of non-stop touring behind  Deluxe  and  Multi-task . It came naturally to Frankie and I but felt like we were headed someplace new. It’s written about falling in love, with who would become my wife, on a 23-hour layover in Casablanca, exploring a new continent, feeling intrigued and truly alive. Keep your ears open for new music in the near future, and be sure to catch Omni on their upcoming tour with Foals and Preoccupations starting tonight, April 12th with a three-night stint at Brooklyn Steel, with additional shows in DC, Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago, and Minneapolis. The band will then return to the road on May 10th, performing at this years  KVRX  Festival in Austin with additional shows throughout the month in El Paso, Tucson, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Everett, WA for the Fisherman’s Village Music Fest, Salt Lake City and Denver, ending on May 22nd in Nashville, TN.

Nearly all of the trio’s songs are built around twitchy, start-stop beats that instantly get pulses rushing and nerves tingling.” -  NPR Music   ” Multi-task  is 11 tracks worth of sonic goodness, heavy on thick and fun guitar licks matched by equally complicated but light lyrics.” - Noisey   “The wiry Atlanta, Ga. rock trio Omni sells its nervous energy as a logical way of dealing with the world. Where other bands might smooth things out, Omni finds angles and sharp turns.” - Pitchfork   “Omni remains a band that’s best at its most berserk.  Multi-Task  hits its high marks when the band is doing as much as it can, or, if you will, multi-tasking.” - PASTE “The Atlanta trio Omni…make twitchy, bouncy, catchy-as-hell post-punk, the sort of thing that  NME  would’ve fallen in love with if it had come from Glasgow in 1983.” -  Stereogum"},

On “Twin Cities,”  The Gotobeds ’ latest single from their upcoming album,  Debt Begins at 30 , the band taps Tracy Wilson, formerly of Dahlia Seed and currently of Positive No, to share the singing, and the result is a fiery, exuberant pop song. When asked about the Shawn Brackbill-directed video, The Gotobeds frontman Eli Kasan said: If you’ve ever toured or spent long stretches of time with the same folks you know nerves can fray. We found a way to release that tension by macing each other for the video. Ever seen the Purge? Me neither, but it’s the same idea. Twin Cities is about two people (the two narrators) having different experiences in the same city, and the video reflects that. Shot entirely on VHS as we’re all old enough to own VCRs, not from Urban Outfitters - take that 90’s nostalgia blowhards! You can watch the band burn through the song via today’s premiere at CLASH Magazine  right here , and listen forever on repeat via  Spotify  or  Apple Music . The Gotobeds will play an album release show in their hometown of Pittsburgh, PA on May 25th at Babyland with midwest & eastern shows in June & July. See below for a full list of dates.

{"title": "Watch Mass Gothic’s Stunning New Video For “How I Love You” From ‘I’ve Tortured You Long Enough’", "date": "TUE, APR 9, 2019 at 900 AM", "preview": "Premiere via Brooklyn Vegan. Here now is  Mass Gothic ’s stunning new video for “ How I Love You,”  the standout from  I’ve Tortured You Long Enough , which is out now worldwide on Sub Pop (see  Brooklyn Vegan  April 9th ).   Mass Gothic’s Jessica Zambri says of the song, “The lights turned on for me. Committing to something can be relieving, even pleasurable.  I used to think I had to protect myself from anything that I perceived to get in the way of making music, but all that did was close me off. Whatever is happening I want to enjoy it. I wrote this song as a reminder to live and not be lived.”   Director Evan Fellers had this to say of the visual, “I wanted to create strange realistic feeling environments that also felt a bit digital. I used a process called photogrammetry to grab a bunch of real-world elements and turned them into 3d models which make up most of everything you see. Anything from small rocks to large sections of woods, trees, moss and dirt, to Jess and Noel.   “I knew I wanted to take the viewer through these different environments, but I wanted it to be more than just a camera flying around — something simple and purposeful, searching for something. I wanted there to be this feeling of a journey. I also wanted to trace specific paths  through the environment I thought were pleasing. Creating a single red orb that illuminated the environment was a nice way to accomplish all of those goals with the story, and control the way in which I revealed each scene at the same time. The red orb also came to represent the voice of the song to me.”   Mass Gothic’s  I’ve Tortured You Long Enough  is available on CD/LP/DL/CS worldwide through  Sub Pop .    What people are saying about Mass Gothic: “Essential…Their earworm-ready songs are made to fight for their right to party.” -  Loud and Quiet   “Mass Gothic’s identity is nearly undefinable, with the pair blasting through genres and ideals with a sort of unsettled energy. Whether losing yourself to the starry synths and complimentary vocals found in the spacey fuzz of “J.Z.O.K.” or floating off in the dazzling airiness, throbbing rhythms and vast instrumental expanse of the album’s title track, the release is one sure to keep you enraptured.” -  The Grey Estates   “Mass Gothic’s greatest strength has always been their freedom to avoid any sort of strict definition…By taking an anything goes approach on their latest album and balancing their creative duties, there’s a through-line that holds the various sounds of their record together…This is a highly intriguing record with so much packed into every moment you’ll be dying to come back.” [8/10] -  Northern Transmissions   “A compelling listen…a record worthy of your time.” -  Bristol Live"},

Minor Poet ’s Andrew Carter had this to say about new song  “Museum District”  , “When Minor Poet became a touring band, I was confronted with just how badly I struggled with social anxiety. Being a musician requires so much public interaction with strangers on top of the soul-bearing of playing intensely personal songs every night. On the other hand, when writing “Museum District,” I wanted to really emphasize how severe social anxiety is not one-dimensional. Everyone who deals with social anxiety also deals with a longing for the life they’re not living, a desire to be there for that one amazing night or life-changing party they’ll always miss because they couldn’t bring themselves to go. All while simultaneously knowing they couldn’t enjoy it even if they were there. Social anxiety is a mess of contradictions that add up to one powerfully limiting state.  The Good News “Museum District” “Tropic of Cancer,”   The Good News  is now available for preorder through  Sub Pop Mega Mart .  Preorders of the LP through  megamart.subpop.com  and  select independent retailers  in North America, UK and Europe will receive the limited Loser edition on clear with red and blue swirl vinyl (while supplies last)."},

Now hear lead track entitled “Father Mountain” and see that an extensive North American, European, and UK tour has been announced with more dates to be added in the coming weeks. See all dates below. Listen to “Father Mountain” on  YouTube  -  Spotify  -  Apple Music [ Photo Credit: Piper Ferguson ] Calexico and Iron & Wine first made an artistic connection with  In the Rein s, the 2005 EP that brought Sam Beam, Joey Burns and John Convertino together. The acclaimed collaboration introduced both acts to wider audiences and broadened Beam’s artistic horizons, but it was the shared experience of touring together in the tradition of Bob Dylan’s “Rolling Thunder Revue” that cemented the bond. Their metaphorical roads diverged in the years that followed, but they kept in touch and cross-pollinated where they could. Although they often talked about rekindling their collaboration in the studio and on stage, it wasn’t until last year that their schedules aligned. Years to Burn  can’t help but be different from  In the Reins . Back then, Calexico entered the studio with a long list of previous collaborations (first in Giant Sand, then backing the likes of Victoria Williams and Richard Buckner) and the knowledge that they loved Sam’s voice and his songs, but wondered if his material was so complete and self-contained that it lacked a way in, so hushed and delicate that it might be overwhelmed. For his part, Beam had been intimidated by their virtuosic playing and their deep comfort in an encyclopedic array of styles. “In my mind, I was a guy who knew three chords and recorded in a closet,” Sam says. “They were playing big stages and were superb musicians.” Those fears were dispelled quickly. Calexico was bowled over by Beam’s many talents: “The arranging, the writing, his sense of rhythm, the quality of his vocals—and then there’s the experimental side of Sam,” Joey says. “They were the perfect band at the perfect time for me,” Sam adds. “I loved all their different sounds. They’re musical anthropologists, not regurgitating but absorbing what they discover.” Nearly 15 years on, “coming back to the project has to do with acknowledging how much impact the first record had for me in my life.”   Years to Burn  was recorded in Nashville with noted producer Matt Ross-Spang over the course of five days at Sound Emporium, a fabled studio founded in the sixties by Cowboy Jack Clement and the site of countless landmark sessions in country and rock over the ensuing decades. It features contributions from veteran Calexico trumpet player Jacob Valenzuela and Paul Niehaus on pedal steel, along with frequent Beam cohorts Rob Burger (Tin Hat Trio) on piano and Sebastian Steinberg (Soul Coughing, Fiona Apple) on bass.   Years to Burn  features ten new original compositions. While Beam wrote all the songs for In the Reins, this recording features contributions from both Beam and Burns as well as from Convertino and those featured on the record. While the two may have taken differing approaches to songwriting, the spirit of collaboration was alive and well in the studio; Sam shared demos ahead of time and was ready for the others to contribute with arrangement ideas and instrumental parts, while Joey spontaneous as ever, came in with concepts and an eagerness to improvise.   “Life is hard. Awesome. And scary as shit. But it can lift you up if you let it,” Sam offers. “These are the things Joey and I write about now. And the title can encapsulate a lot of things. ‘Years to Burn’ could mean you’re cocky, you’ve got it made. Or, our life is ours to burn, to be inspired. Or you’re burned by life, brutalized. It’s an ambiguous title, because life is complicated. Let’s not talk like teenagers about love, desire, pain, ‘cause we’re not teenagers. And that’s not a bad thing.”   “This project had to find the right time,” Joey concludes. “We’re all different people than we were in 2004, and music helps to bridge some of the gaps. For all the things going on in our world and in each of our lives, this connection, this friendship, this love that we have—this album is a vehicle for that bond.

Our generation is the most cinematically saturated of all time. Videotapes, DVD’s, streaming… Spielberg…all of it has thrust us into an endless loop of consumption. They provide formative experiences as children, standing larger than life before our fragile adolescent minds. I wanted to take a look into the emotionally manipulative powers of Movies - how have Movies succeeded in telling the myths of our time? How have they failed (miserably)? What is the consequent effect on a society of beings looking for themselves in the myths on the screen? It’s safe to say that they have failed us, but I can’t help it…I love Movies.” Weyes Blood will release  Titanic Rising , her fourth album and Sub Pop records debut, worldwide on CD/LP/DL/CS April 5th, 2019.

The legendary  Preservation Hall Jazz Band  have just released “ Kreyol ,”  a spirited new tune from  “A Tuba To Cuba,”  the forthcoming soundtrack to the critically acclaimed documentary directed by T.G. Herrington and Danny Clinch.  The song is available today on all DSPs worldwide from  Sub Pop  and also  YouTube  -  Spotify  -  Apple Music . “A Tuba to Cuba” follows Ben Jaffe of New Orleans’ famed Preservation Hall Jazz Band as he seeks to fulfill his late father’s dream of retracing their musical roots to the shores of Cuba in search of the indigenous music that gave birth to New Orleans jazz. “A Tuba to Cuba” celebrates the triumph of the human spirit expressed through the universal language of music and challenges us to resolve to build bridges, not walls. Beginning today, the film will also be available through Amazon Video, iTunes, DirecTV, Google Play, YouTube Movies and more. Check your local service provider for additional listings. The New York Times says of the film, “This joyous, wide-ranging account of a New Orleans jazz band’s 2015 visit to Cuba is crammed with fascinating facts and toe-tickling tunes.” And the LA Times offers this, “Jaunty, at times poetic chats and drop-ins with many Big Easy and Cuban jazz artists, discussion of their music’s African lineage (the Atlantic slave trade factored in), stirring examples of native instrumentation, and pulsating performances combine with colorful, travelogue-type shots (love those old Cuban theaters) and vivid archival footage to create a vibrant and joyous portrait.” Preservation Hall Jazz Band’s Ben Jaffe says of “Kreyol,” “Every evening in Havana people gather along the waterfront to socialize. I’ve always been taken by the tempo at which people stroll, like New Orleans, there’s a very particular rhythm to their walk. That rhythm was the inspiration for “Kreyol”.  In fact, “Kreyol” is the Cuban spelling of “Creole”. You can feel that same Creole influence in New Orleans, it’s one of our many shared connections with Cuba.” Preservation Hall Jazz Band Tour Dates Preservation Hall Jazz Band’s touring schedule for 2019 currently spans April 12th through September 22nd.

On May 31st,  The Gotobeds  - Cary, TFP, Eli and Gavin - return to the fray with their third full lengther,  Debt Begins at 30 . The  esprit de corps  and anxiety-free joy that permeates their other LPs and EPs remains intact. The octane is high-test, the engine still has knocks and pings and the battery is overcharged. The Gotobeds - as Pittsburgh as it gets, the folk music of the Steel City - have more tar for us to swallow.  Debt Begins at 30  is an old-fashioned blast furnace and the liquid iron flows. The album’s first single, “Calquer the Hound,” features guest performances by Kim Phuc singer Rob Henry, and Evan Richards of The City Buses. (The album has guests on all eleven tracks - see the track list below for the details.) The song has euphony, a sly bridge, plenty of trademark bash, and a spacey outro.

Bleached Midnight (with Pittsburgh poet Scott MacIntyre) 11. Debt Begins at 30 (Alt version) (with Victoria Ruiz of Downtown Boys) About The Gotobeds  Debt Begins at 30 : Give me a minute or three to extol the virtues of The Gotobeds, the modern rock-and-roll sensation that has always sounded like they love to play. Never maligned by having the world’s weight on their backs, The Gotobeds - Cary, TFP, Eli and Gavin - return to the fray with their third full lengther,  Debt Begins at 30 . The  esprit de corps  and anxiety-free joy that permeates their other LPs and EPs remains intact. The octane is high-test, the engine still has knocks and pings and the battery is overcharged. The Gotobeds - as Pittsburgh as it gets, the folk music of the Steel City - have more tar for us to swallow.  Debt Begins at 30  is an old-fashioned blast furnace and the liquid iron flows.  Debt Begins at 30  is not “pub sop” in any way or shape.   Though I never considered The Gotobeds a band that needed assistance from their peers,  Debt Begins at 30  features outside contributors on every track. The album’s first single, “Calquer the Hound,” includes local buddy Evan Richards, and Rob Henry of Kim Phuc. “Calquer the Hound” has euphony, a sly bridge, plenty of trademark bash, and a spacey outro. It’s a sanguine album opener, more Al Oliver than Starling Marte.   On “Twin Cities,” the lads tap Tracy Wilson, formerly of Dahlia Seed and currently of Positive NO!, to share the vox, and the result is an exuberant pop song proving The Gotobeds benefit from women ruling the scene. “Twin Cities” is more Dakota Staton than Don Caballero. “Debt Begins at 30,” the title trackular, includes the wizardry of Mike Seamans and legend Bob Weston. It’s a brooding romp with tribal beats and slash-and-burn guitar, more Rocky Bleier than Le’Veon Bell.   Unsurprisingly, The Gotobeds called partners-in-rock-crime Protomartyr a coupla times, with Joe Casey bolstering “Slang Words” and hook-fiend Greg Ahee shredding on “On Loan.” “Slang Words” is a savory wrecking ball with a crunching bite, more of a soft shell crab sandwich from Wholey’s Market than a 4am slop feast at Primanti Brothers. “On Loan” is an anthemic jangle-fest with high-arcing fret work, more Karl Hendricks (rest his soul) than “Weird Paul” Petroskey.   Silkworm guitarist Tim Midyett is tapped on “Parallel,” a grand song that enters a world of whimsy, melodic and uncomplicated, more Jaromir Jagr than Sidney Crosby. The likes of 12XU label boss Gerard Cosloy, Tre Orsi’s Matt Barnhart, the wonderful Victoria Ruiz of Downtown Boys, Pittsburgh wordsmiths Jason Baldinger and Scott MacIntyre, and yours truly strut stuff on other tracks. In my case, I just scream “dross” on “Dross” several times. Good judgment on the part of The Gotobeds to know that’s the best I can do, more Max Moroff than Andrew McCutchen.   Anyways, The Gotobeds have quickly reached the veteran stage, but, based upon  Debt Begins at 30 , their best days are ahead of them. It’s a pleasure to be associated with such an excellent band.   –Bob Nastanovich, 1/13/2019, Des Moines"},

It’s taken a while to finish the song, to make it feel like the initial feeling. I can’t neatly describe it, but something like connection despite distance.

{"title": "Trupa Trupa signs to Sub Pop to release new music in 2019, shares official video for “Dream About”", "date": "TUE, FEB 26, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "Sub Pop has signed Trupa Trupa from Gdańsk, Poland for a worldwide deal, and will release new music from the group in 2019. While we await details of that release, the band have delivered an official video for  “Dream About”   a new song that features a honeyed falsetto that totters over a menacing bassline, and the frisson between them so hypnotic it renders the title phrase as an existential mantra, a lifeline. Director Benjamin Finger had this to say of the “Dream About” visual: “The video was shot on Super 8, a format I am strongly connected to, and I think it fits the music of Trupa Trupa. There is something poetic about the music, and I think it matches the images in a good way. The “Dream About” video is also about seeing the world through the eyes of the child. The video features footage shot on location in Vancouver, Paris and Buenos Aires.” Trupa Trupa will tour the world in 2019, beginning with appearances at SXSW in Austin, Texas (March 14th-16th), and Slovakia and Poland (April 25th-27th). Additional shows will be announced soon.

During “Dream About,” honeyed falsetto totters over a menacing bassline, the frisson between them so hypnotic it renders the title phrase as an existential mantra, a lifeline. Their music is an embarrassment of riches, a string of hits in Trupa Trupa’s idiosyncratic, self-made universe. But just beneath the surface of Trupa Trupa’s bright and indelible songs, there is a world teeming with nihilistic considerations, slyly dark humor, and survivalist self-assurances, all subtly nestled into these refrains and reflected back by secretly complex textures. The setting of Gdańsk is a crucial philosophical and aesthetic touchstone for Trupa Trupa. A city with a convoluted history of German and Polish rule and self-sovereignty, it is itself a living testament to the turnover of human toil. It’s also the homeland of Arthur Schopenhauer, a philosopher whose system of metaphysical will inspired Nietzsche and, in turn, Trupa Trupa. Klaus Kinski was born nearby, too; Kwiatkowski considers his Werner Herzog-directed film, Fitzcarraldo, one of the best movies ever made. Kinski tries in vain to amass a fortune by piloting a steamship over a mountain into the rubber bonanza of the Amazon. It is a portrait of great effort and pathetic failure, of strain sublimating into nothing. Along with the notions of Beckett, hints of the Beatles, and the knotty complications of Radiohead, these emotions ripple through Trupa Trupa’s music.   Trupa Trupa is the second Polish band to sign to Sub Pop this year, following the February release of Perfect Son’s debut, Cast. As with Perfect Son, Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman, who has long taken a personal interest in the culture and history of Poland, has been following Trupa Trupa for years. In a 2013 interview with Pitchfork, he even mistook their second album, ++, for a set of demos when explaining that he was trying to decide whether or not he liked it. Apparently, he did. But Trupa Trupa has grown inordinately in both confidence and execution during the last half-decade. Spurred on by a democratic process, where no one is the real leader and all ideas and influences are funneled into the same rich sound, Trupa Trupa channel a multiverse of feelings into its captivating music. They stare into the dark and summon a light of their own, making all our tedium and toil feel not just tolerable but deceptively triumphant."},
{"title": "Minor Poet to Release ‘The Good News’ Worldwide on May 17th Through Sub Pop", "date": "THU, FEB 21, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "Sub Pop welcomes Richmond, VA’s  Minor Poet  who will release  The Good News , his label debut on LP/DL on May 17th, 2019. The six-song collection, which features the ebullient lead single  “Tropic of Cancer,”  was produced by Andrew Carter and Adrian Olsen (Natalie Prass, Foxygen) at Montrose Recording in Richmond. The Good News  is now available for preorder through  Sub Pop Mega Mart .  Preorders of the LP through  megamart.subpop.com  and  select independent retailers  will receive the limited Loser edition on clear with red and blue swirl vinyl (while supplies last).    About Minor Poet’s The Good News: After spending years writing and recording music by himself in various bedrooms and basements, Andrew Carter hit his stride with the debut Minor Poet album,  And How! . Made on a creative whim with no outside expectations, the eleven-song collection combined Carter’s love of carefully-crafted pop with a loose, fun, off-the-cuff recording aesthetic. The album was released in 2017 and developed a small but loving fan base, and Minor Poet has grown from a passion project into a cross-country touring band with write-ups in publications such as  American Songwriter ,  Magnet ,  The Wild Honey Pie ,  Impose , and more. Minor Poet’s second album,  The Good News , is a six-song collection that expands the boundaries of what constitutes the band’s sound. In just twenty-two minutes, the songs take apart the standard formulas of guitar-based rock and infuse them with vibrance and energy. On opener “Tabula Rasa,” interlocking guitars and a Farfisa organ carry the song through until everything drops suddenly into a doo-wop section that wouldn’t be out of place on a 1950’s greatest hits compilation. Warped noise envelops a tropicalia-flavored Casio beat in “Tropic of Cancer” before a slick groove and sliding bass line lead into the chorus’ pure pop bliss of horns and vocal harmonies. “Museum District” begins with a drum intro reminiscent of an off-kilter “Be My Baby,” and “Bit Your Tongue/All Alone Now” features a midsection with a glam-rock guitar solo amidst trumpet fanfare. These are just a few of the infectious moments on an EP filled with many more. The Good News  was made over four days at Montrose Recording, in Minor Poet’s hometown of Richmond, Virginia. In the past, Carter played all the instruments and handled all the production, but he knew that he had to reach outside himself to do justice to these songs. “I couldn’t capture the sounds I heard in my head,” Carter explains. “I wanted something that was vast and expansive but that at the same time could hit you immediately in the gut.” Paying homage to the “wall of sound” techniques made famous by Brian Wilson and Phil Spector, Carter and co-producer Adrian Olsen (Natalie Prass, Foxygen) overdubbed layer after layer of Carter playing an array of guitars, pianos, organs, synths, and percussion, as well as singing all the harmonies. The members of Minor Poet’s touring band were brought in to perform the core rhythm section, and local musicians stopped by to add crucial flourishes, such as the harmonizing guitar riffs in “Reverse Medusa” and the saxophone solo that closes out “Nude Descending Staircase.” At the center of everything is Carter’s voice, singing lyrics that seamlessly mix allusions to religion, mythology, art, and philosophy as he questions himself, his place in the world around him, what he owes to his relationships, and, in turn, what he needs to ask of others in order to stay healthy. “Tabula Rasa” is a concept that argues that humans are born blank slates, shaped through experience and environment. The last two years couldn’t have felt more applicable for Carter, who started out as a fresh face with little-to-no experience in the music industry and slowly grew into himself as a stage performer and bandleader through both good and bad times. During this period he began to come to terms with lifelong struggles, such as the depression that permeates “Tropic of Cancer” and the social anxiety that runs through “Museum District.” Rather than be one-dimensional, however, Carter dives deeper into himself and his motivations, such as in “Reverse Medusa” when he sings, “Hide my love in poetic half-truths/never was one to dwell on my issues.” Carter’s ability to balance emotional honesty with a tongue-in-cheek self-awareness adds to the richness and originality of the music. Short but memorable, catchy yet meaningful,  The Good News  is another promising step forward for Minor Poet. The Good News Tracklisting 1. Tabula Rasa 2. Tropic of Cancer 3. Museum District 4.

Miles and Miles About Tacocat’s  This Mess Is a Place :  When Seattle band Tacocat—vocalist Emily Nokes, bassist Bree McKenna, guitarist Eric Randall, and drummer Lelah Maupin—first started in 2007, the world they were responding to was vastly different from the current Seattle scene of diverse voices they’ve helped foster. It was a world of house shows, booking DIY tours on MySpace, and writing funny, deliriously catchy feminist pop-punk songs when feminism was the quickest way to alienate yourself from the then-en vogue garage-rock bros. Their lyrical honesty, humor, and hit-making sensibilities have built the band a fiercely devoted fanbase over the years, one that has followed them from basements to dive bars to sold-out shows at the Showbox. Every step along the way has been a seamless progression—from silly songs about Tonya Harding and psychic cats to calling out catcallers and poking fun at entitled weekend-warrior tech jerks on their last two records on Hardly Art, 2014’s  NVM  and 2016’s  Lost Time .   This Mess is a Place , Tacocat’s fourth full-length and first on Sub Pop,finds the band waking up the morning after the 2016 election and figuring out how to respond to a new reality where evil isn’t hiding under the surface at all—it’s front and center, with new tragedies and civil rights assaults filling up the scroll of the newsfeed every day. “What a time to be barely alive,” laments “Crystal Ball,” a gem that examines the more intimate side of responding emotionally to the news cycle. How do you keep fighting when all you want to do is stay in bed all day? “Stupid computer stupor/Oh my kingdom for some better ads,” Nokes sings, throwing in some classic Tacocat snark, “Truth spread so thin/It stops existing.”   Despite current realities being depressing enough to make anyone want to crawl under the covers and sleep for a thousand years, Tacocat are doing what they’ve always done so well: mingling brightness, energy, and hope with political critique.  This Mess is a Place  is charged with a hopefulness that stands in stark contrast to music that celebrates apathy, despair, and numbness. Tacocat feels it all and cares,  a lot , whether they’re singing odes to the magical connections we feel with our pets (“Little Friend”), imagining what a better earth might look like (“New World”), or trying to find humor in a wholly unfunny world (“The Joke of Life”).   Throughout the album, Tacocat questions power structures and the way we interact with them, recalling the feminist sci-fi of Ursula K. Le Guin in pop-music form. “Rose-Colored Sky” examines the privilege of people who have been able to skate through life without ever experiencing systemic disadvantage: “For all the years spent/Hot lava shaping me/For all the arguments/I wonder who else would I be?” Nokes sings. “If I wasn’t on the battleground/I bet I could’ve gone to space by now.” “Hologram” reminds us to step outside ourselves and try to see beyond imaginary structures that trap us: “Just close your eyes and think about the Milky Way/Just remember if you can, power is a hologram.”   The record is full of beautiful details, finding plastic beaded curtains catching light amidst feelings of despair.  This Mess is A Place  explores politics with more nuance than the topical songs of Tacocat’s past, inviting listeners in for more complicated exchanges and leaving space for introspection. “Grains of Salt” finds the band at the best they’ve ever sounded: Maupin’s spirited drums, McKenna’s bouncy walking bass, Randall’s catchy guitar and Nokes’ soaring melody combine to create a bonafide roller-rink hit that reminds us that it just takes some time, we’re in the middle of the ride, and to live for what matters to you. It’s a delightfully cathartic moment and the cornerstone of the record when they exclaim: “Don’t forget to remember who the fuck you are!”   Producer Erik Blood (who also produced  Lost Time ) brings the band into their full pop potential but still preserves what makes Tacocat so special: they’re four friends who met as young punks and have grown together into a truly collaborative band. Says Nokes: “We can examine some hard stuff, make fun of some evil stuff, feel some soft feelings, feel some rage feelings, feel some bitter-ass feelings, sift through memories, feel wavy-existential, and still go get a banana daiquiri at the end.”   —Robin Edwards"},

The track plays on a few themes (mythology, astronomy, technology), and is ultimately a love song about finding something long-lasting in an ever-changing world full of distractions, unrealistic expectations (“looking up to the sky for, something I may never find”) and past disappointments.  Stereogum  recently named “Andromeda” one of its songs of the week, and said “There are few contemporary artists who sound like Natalie Mering. Her voice is enchanting, and on this song, she asks listeners to give themselves over to love, as if doing so will allow them to live in her plush, technicolor world a little longer.” And  The FADER  raves “…Mering, crafts melodies that feel rooted in another space and time.”  About Weyes Blood’s  Titanic Rising : The phantom zone, the parallax, the upside down—there is a rich cultural history of exploring in-between places. Through her latest, Titanic Rising , Weyes Blood (a.k.a. Natalie Mering) has, too, designed her own universe to soulfully navigate life’s mysteries. Maneuvering through a space-time continuum, she intriguingly plays the role of a melodic, sometimes melancholic, anthropologist.   Tellingly, Mering classifies  Titanic Rising  as the Kinks meet WWII or Bob Seger meets Enya. The latter captures the album’s willful expansiveness (“You can tell there’s not a guy pulling the strings in Enya’s studio,” she notes, admiringly). The former relays her imperative to connect with listeners. “The clarity of Bob Seger is unmistakable. I’m a big fan of conversational songwriting,” she adds. “I just try to do that in a way that uses abstract imagery as well.”   “An album is like a Rubik’s Cube,” she says. “Sometimes you get all the dimensions—the lyrics, the melody, the production—to line up. I try to be futuristic and ancient at once, which is a difficult alchemy. It’s taken a lot of different tries to get it right.” As concept-album as it may sound, it’s also a devoted exercise in realism, albeit occasionally magical. Here, the throwback-cinema grandeur of “A Lot’s Gonna Change” gracefully coexists with the otherworldly title track, an ominous instrumental.    Titanic Rising , written and recorded during the first half of 2018, is the culmination of three albums and years of touring: stronger chops and ballsier decisions. It’s an achievement in transcendent vocals and levitating arrangements—one she could reach only by flying under the radar for so many years. “I used to want to belong,” says the L.A. based musician. “I realized I had to forge my own path. Nobody was going to do that for me. That was liberating. I became a Joan of Arc solo musician.”   The Weyes Blood frontwoman grew up singing in gospel and madrigal choirs. “Classical and Renaissance music really influenced me,” says Mering, who first picked up a guitar at age 8. (Listen closely to  Titanic Rising , and you’ll also hear the jazz of Hoagy Carmichael mingle with the artful mysticism of Alejandro Jodorowsky and the monomyth of scholar Joseph Campbell.) “Something to Believe,” a confessional that makes judicious use of the slide guitar, touches on that cosmological upbringing. “Belief is something all humans need. Shared myths are part of our psychology and survival,” she says. “Now we have a weird mishmash of capitalism and movies and science. There have been moments where I felt very existential and lost.”   As a kid, she filled that void with  Titanic . (Yes, the movie.) “It was engineered for little girls and had its own mythology,” she explains. Mering also noticed that the blockbuster romance actually offered a story about loss born of man’s hubris. “It’s so symbolic that the  Titanic  would crash into an iceberg, and now that iceberg is melting, sinking civilization.” Today, this hubris also extends to the relentless adoption of technology, at the expense of both happiness and attention spans.   The track “Movies” marks another  Titanic -related epiphany: “that movies had been brainwashing people and their ideas about romantic love.” To that end, Mering has become an expert at deconstructing intimacy. Sweeping and string-laden, “Andromeda” seems engineered to fibrillate hearts. “It’s about losing your interest in trying to be in love,” she says. “Everybody is their own galaxy, their own separate entity. There is a feeling of needing to be saved, and that’s a lot to ask of people.” Its companion track, “Everyday,” “is about the chaos of modern dating,” she says, “the idea of sailing off onto your ships to nowhere to deal with all your baggage.”   But Weyes Blood isn’t one to stew. Her observations play out in an ethereal saunter: far more meditative than cynical. “I experience reality on a slower, more hypnotic level,” she says. “I’m a more contemplative kind of writer.” To Mering, listening and thinking are concurrent experiences. “There are complicated influences mixed in with more relatable nostalgic melodies,” she says. “In my mind, my music feels so big, a true production. I’m not a huge, popular artist, but I feel like one when I’m in the studio. But it’s never taking away from the music. I’m just making a bigger space for myself.”"},
{"title": "Sub Pop’s 2019 Loser Scholarship Details!", "date": "FRI, FEB 8, 2019 at 855 AM", "preview": "Seattle’s Sub Pop Records is extremely proud to announce the return (for our 13th year!) of The Sub Pop Loser Scholarship. Further details on the scholarship are below, and even further below is some clarification on what we mean by “Loser.”  Sub Pop Records is offering a grand total of $15,000 in college scholarship money to three eligible high school seniors. There are three scholarships—one for $7,000, one for $5,000 and one for $3,000. As longtime, proud losers ourselves, we’re exceedingly happy to be able, in some small way, to help further the education of art-enthused misfits from the NW. Applicants must be residents of Washington or Oregon, and graduating seniors on the way to full-time enrollment at an accredited university or college. We are looking for applicants who are involved and/or interested in music and/or the creative arts in some way. However, you do not need to be pursuing an education in the arts. To apply  you must submit an essay, one page or less, using any combination of the following questions as a guide (or write something completely your own, be inspired and creative!). Please list the school you are graduating from and the school you plan to attend in the fall at the top of your essay along with your contact information.  - What are you doing in the arts/music field in your community? - What does being a Sub Pop ‘Loser’ mean to you? - What are your influences and/or who inspired you to become involved in the arts? - Describe your biggest failure and explain how it has brought you closer to your goal(s). - Discuss a special attribute or accomplishment that sets you apart. - How has your family or community background affected the way you see the world? - Why should you be the Loser winner? Applicants are strongly (!) encouraged to send digital links and/or provide hard copies of their artwork, photos of community involvement, radio show links, videos, etc. along with their essay (we have never had a winner who submitted only an essay w/no extras). However, please be aware that Sub Pop will not return any of this material, so please don’t send originals. Sub Pop will give equal opportunity to all applicants who fit the criteria outlined above.  The deadline for applications is Wednesday, March 20th, 2019. Please send all submissions and attachments to scholarship@subpop.com  by Wednesday, March 20th . We will announce the scholarship winners during the first week of April. What we talk about when we talk about “Loser.”   Here at Sub Pop Records, we use the word “loser” a lot. You may have noticed. We’ve printed it on things we sell (hats, shirts, stickers, mugs, and more!), we call the first, colored-vinyl, limited-edition pressings of the records we release the “Loser Edition,” and every year since 2007 we’ve awarded tuition money to college-bound NW high school students through the “Sub Pop Loser Scholarship.” And, it’s possible we take for granted that you guys catch our drift and understand what we mean when we’re all “loser this,” and “loser that.” So! The following…    Sub Pop’s use of the word “loser” goes back to the foundation of the label and is meant as a celebration of unabashedly being ourselves without conforming to any preconceived ideas of “normal.” To be a loser is central to the very idea of underground art and culture - all of it happening and thriving outside of the mainstream, and not necessarily looking for a way in. Bruce Pavitt’s “New Pop Manifesto” in the 1st issue of Subterranean Pop included, “The important thing to remember is this: the most intense music, the most original ideas… are coming out of scenes you don’t even know exist… Only by supporting new ideas by local artists, bands, and record labels can the U.S. expect any kind of dynamic social/cultural change…” And, since 2007, with the Loser Scholarship, we’ve been adding students to that list, and putting our (or, our co-founder, big boss and biggest loser ever, Jonathan Poneman’s…) money where our mouth is. Sub Pop Records strives to bring attention to music and art from the fringes that might otherwise remain marginalized. And, in that same spirit, through our annual Loser Scholarship, we’re looking for art-enthused misfits in NW high schools, losers like us, to help them pay for college. We stand proudly with and support the misfits, weirdos and losers, because we believe that when we’re able to proudly be nothing other than our true selves, we have the ability to make the world stronger, smarter and better. So, good luck, Losers!  And, again, please send all submissions and attachments to scholarship@subpop.com by Wednesday, March 20th."},
{"title": "Sub Pop Will Reissue Luluc’s debut album ‘Dear Hamlyn’ on Vinyl and Digital (out Friday, March 8th)", "date": "MON, FEB 4, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "It’s the first time  Dear Hamlyn  will be available outside of Australasia. The band’s UK, European, and Ireland tour dates for 2019 begin tomorrow in London. On March 8th,  Luluc’s   Dear Hamlyn , the duo’s debut album, will be available for the first time worldwide (outside of Australasia) on vinyl and through all DSPs from Sub Pop. This gives fans the first opportunity to discover the minimalist folk sound from which the band grew. A long player in the tradition of Nick Drake, you can see (above) the Lucy Dyson animated video for “The Wealthiest Queen”. Luluc released Dear Hamlyn in Australia in 2008. After her father passed away, Zoe Randell reevaluated her life and came to the conclusion that it was time to focus her energy on music. What resulted was a starkly simple yet dramatically moving work which slowly but surely began to make waves in Australia and beyond. Early advocates and tours with artists like Lucinda Williams, Fleet Foxes, and José Gonzàlez got the band on their way to cult acclaim.   Dear Hamlyn, over the following years, became cherished by fans who had discovered it upon independent release, some of whom were more marquee names in music: like The National and Aaron Dessner (who would go on to produce Passerby and appear on Sculptor, the bands subsequent albums), Nick Drake producer Joe Boyd and No Depression co-founder Peter Blackstock. “The most beautiful record I have heard in 10 years,” wrote Blackstock, who then put the band in contact with Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman. Poneman was immediately won over. He arranged a meeting, and signed Luluc.   Dear Hamlyn  is now available for preorder from  Sub Pop .  LP preorders through  megamart.subpop.com  and  select independent retailers  in North America and Europe will receive the limited Loser edition on pearlescent vinyl (while supplies last).

Directed by Emmy Award winner Katie Mitchell using archival footage, some of which was sourced from NASA. “The clip touches on themes of mortality, memory and our place in the universe”, says Mitchell. And Randell offers this on the collaboration, “We’re in awe of Katie Mitchell as a director and artist. The video she has made for the song “Sculptor” is deep and stunning. As a writer, there is no greater thrill than someone understanding and articulating your work visually like you are of one mind.”"},

{"title": "Masked Country Crooner Orville Peck to Release Pony, His Sub Pop Debut, on March 22nd", "date": "WED, JAN 16, 2019 at 700 AM", "preview": "Masked country crooner Orville Peck will release  Pony , his full-length debut, on CD/LP/DL March 22nd worldwide through Sub Pop, with the exception of Canada where the album will be released by Royal Mountain Records.     Pony , which features the lead single and official video for  “Dead of Night,”  along with the highlights “Turn to Hate,” “Buffalo Run,” and the previously released “Big Sky,” was produced by Orville Peck, recorded and mixed by Jordan Koop at The Noise Floor on Gabriola Island, British Columbia and mastered by Harris Newman at Grey Market Mastering in Montreal, Quebec.   “Dead of Night” is a torch song about two hustlers traveling through Nevada desert. Young drifters whose whirlwind romance takes us on a dusty trail of memories - racing down canyon highways, hitchhiking through casino towns and ending ultimately in tragedy. Orville recalls the adventures of his young love as he watches the boys silently pass him on the strip, haunted by the happy memories of his past.   The “Dead of Night” video follows Orville and his posse of companions - a washed up gambler, a Cubano boxer, a Senegalese cowgirl, and a Wild West club kid (Played by Hopper Penn, Alex Cammen, Magné Ndiaye and Dez Sam, respectively). “Dead of Night” was directed by Michael Maxxis, and shot on location in Nevada at the legendary Chicken Ranch brothel (the real-life inspiration for  The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas ), and features many of the ladies who work there.  Orville Peck’s previously announced late winter and spring international tour schedule for 2019 has been extended through May 19th. The newly added headlining North American shows (April 11th-May 3rd, May 8th, and May 13th-19th) will have Orville and his band making new stops in Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Baltimore, Richmond, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver.  Additional highlights include: London residency shows February 28th-March 2nd; A free show in Paris, France on March 5th; Halden, Germany on March 5th; Berlin, Germany on March 6th; and support dates with Lord Huron May 6th-7th and May 9th-12th.  Feb. 28 - London, UK - Islington Mar. 01 - London, UK - Servant Jazz Quarters Mar. 02 - London, UK - The Shacklewell Arms Mar. 04 - Paris, FR - Supersonic (Free Show) Mar. 05 - Haldern, DE - Pop Bar Mar. 06 - Berlin, DE - Auster-Club Apr. 11 - Ottawa, ON - The Dominion Tavern Apr. 12 - Montreal, QC - La Sala Rosa Apr. 13 - Toronto, ON - The Great Hall Apr. 25 - Philadelphia, PA - The Boot & Saddle Apr. 26 - Brooklyn, NY - Zone One @ Elsewhere Apr. 27 - Baltimore, MD - Metro Gallery Apr. 28 - Richmond, VA - The Camel Apr. 30 - Pittsburg, PA - Andy Warhol Museum May 01 - Lakewood, OH - Mahall’s May 02 - Detroit, MI - Lager House May 03 - Chicago, IL - Empty Bottle May 06 - Columbia, MO - The Blue Note* May 07 - Oklahoma City, OK - The Criterion* May 08 - Austin, TX - The Mohawk May 09 - El Paso, TX - Lowbrow Palace* May 10 - Albuquerque, NM - Sunshine Theatre* May 11 - Tucson, AZ - Rialto Theatre* May 12 - Phoenix, AZ - The Van Buren* May 13 - Los Angeles, CA - The Moroccan Lounge May 15 - San Francisco, CA - Cafe Du Nord May 17 - Portland, OR - Mississippi Studios May 18 - Seattle, WA - Barboza May 19 - Vancouver, BC - The Wise Hall * w/ Lord Huron   Pony  is now available for preorder through  Sub Pop Mega Mart  and Royal Mountain Records.

{"title": "Listen To The Remastered Title Track From Green River’s ‘Rehab Doll,’ and “Unwind” From ‘Dry As a Bone’", "date": "THU, JAN 10, 2019 at 657 AM", "preview": "The Deluxe Editions of  Rehab Doll  and  Dry As a Bone  will be available Friday, January 25th worldwide via Sub Pop. You can now hear remastered versions of  the riff heavy title track  from  Green River ’s  Rehab Doll , and the  bluesy grind of “Unwind” from  Dry As a Bone . Both albums will be available as expanded and remastered deluxe editions from  Sub Pop  on CD/2xLP/DL worldwide January 25th, 2019. Jack Endino served as the executive producer for the project excavating & restoring tapes, mixing, remixing & mastering both packages. LP preorders of each album through  Sub Pop Mega Mart  and  select independent retailers  will receive the limited Loser editions of  Dry As a Bone  on forest green vinyl and  Rehab Doll  on opaque lime green vinyl (while supplies last). Rolling Stone  had this to say of  Rehab Doll : “Proto-grunge at its best, its mud-dipped tracks breaking down and building themselves back up in real time. Frontman Mark Arm (later of Mudhoney) sounds like he gargled with lye before cutting tracks like the boogie-gone-bad “Together We’ll Never,” while the band’s rip-roaring cover of David Bowie’s “Queen Bitch” (originally only available on the album’s cassette release) hints at the wry humor that would animate much of the Seattle scene’s best moments.” And  Magnet Magazine  offers this, “Not only did Green River exemplify the collision of punk, metal and classic rock that became the early Seattle sound’s calling card, it eventually spawned some of the most recognizable faces of the grunge era….Green River sound is exactly what you would expect, with the tension of competing styles (Arm’s unhinged, punk-rock shriek vs. Gossard and Ament’s bluesy metal wanking) forming a singular, if combustible, mix….The impact is something akin to a beer bottle to the head, and it still reverberates 20 years later.” [Photo Credit: Charles Peterson] About Green River’s  Dry As a Bone  and  Rehab Doll :  The story of Seattle’s rise to global rock supremacy in the late ’80s and early ’90s begins with Green River. Made up of Jeff Ament (bass), Mark Arm (guitar/vocals), Bruce Fairweather (guitar), Stone Gossard (guitar), and Alex Shumway (drums), the quintet put out three 12”s and a 7” single during its brief existence. But Green River’s influence on Seattle’s music scene spread far and wide—thanks to the members’ dispersion into bands including Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, and Love Battery, as well as the punk-glam-sludge-rock songs they left behind (read more  here )."},

Fans of a more youthful age may remember the second and third editions, which ran from 1998-2002 and 2008-2009, respectively, and together included hitmakers like Iron and Wine, Bright Eyes, The White Stripes, Death Cab for Cutie, Jesus and Mary Chain, The Get Up Kids, The Dutchess and the Duke, Om, Thee Oh Sees, and many more.    All of this ancient history is to say:  1.

{"title": "Sub Pop Signs Perfect Son To Release ‘Cast,’ His Debut Album Out February 15th, 2019. Now Listen To Lead Single “It’s For Life”", "date": "WED, NOV 28, 2018 at 659 AM", "preview": "Sub Pop has signed Polish artist Perfect Son (aka Tobiasz Biliński) for the world, to release  Cast ,  his label debut on CD/LP/DL February 15th, 2019. The 10 track album, which features the lead single “It’s For Life,” along with the highlights “Promises,” and “Lust,” was co-produced by Biliński and Marcin Buźniak at Axis Audio in Warsaw, with additional production from Jeff Zeigler at Uniform Recording in Philadelphia, and mixed/mastered by Buźniak. On “It’s For Life,” Biliński’s soft falsetto and arching melodies are embedded in a world of enormous drums, pounded piano, and blown-out bass. The lyric video (as seen above, and also heard on  Spotify  or  Apple Music ) was co-directed by Biliński and his wife Anna Mayer-Bilińska, and shot in his hometown of Sopot, and in Warsaw, where he now resides.  Cast  is now available for pre-order via the  Sub Pop Mega Mart  and  select independent retailers .  Those who pre-order the record through  megamart.subpop.com  will receive the limited edition version on yellow vinyl while supplies last.

Almost Mine More About Perfect Son and ‘Cast’ Sometime in 2016, just as the Polish singer and producer Tobiasz Biliński began to find success through the dim and fractured electropop of Coldair, he knew it was time for a radical change. The songs on  The Provider , Coldair’s much-lauded third album, had been an exorcism of sorts. Laced with songs about early death, chronic disappointment, and clouded minds, the record was, as he puts it now, his earnest attempt to “get all this old shit out.” That mission accomplished, he needed something new, a restart—the unabashedly radiant and unapologetically complex pop of Perfect Son, delivered in 10 perfect shots on Biliński’s Sub Pop debut,  Cast .  [ Photo Credit Weronika Izdebska ] In the past, Biliński’s music has flirted with and explored the darkness, first in a sort of Transatlantic freak-folk and then with the gothic refractions of Coldair. But on  Cast , Perfect Son steps boldly into the light without sloughing off emotional weight or depth. With powerful, sweeping production that recalls the best pop beats of Matthew Dear and arcing melodies that conjure the majesty of Jonathan Meiburg, Perfect Son animates sensations of lust, belonging, and newfound trust with tumescent electronic arrangements that threaten the safety of any sound system.    On opener “Reel Me,” his soft falsetto floats through a Steve Reich-like pulse and above an ominous guitar, as he describes the feeling of a soul lost in the wilderness and doubting his own humanity. But the drums and the bass stir him awake, giving him a sense of vitality and belonging: “I’m finally aware,” he confesses, eyes brightened. “And fearing things.” During the thunderous “It’s For Life,” Biliński wraps his voice around a world of enormous drums, pounded piano, and blown-out bass. “It’s alright/It’s for life,” the newly married singer offers in the instantaneous chorus.   Biliński doesn’t forsake the heavier things here. The haunted “Old Desires” battles latent demons, soundtracked by howling synthesizers and harmonies that seem to hang in the distance like ghosts. The sweeping closer “Almost Mine” is a candid confession of pain and a frank acknowledgment that, one day, even the relationships that give us strength and purpose will crumble. Biliński sings about falls throughout  Cast  but also about picking yourself back up, about pressing on despite or perhaps because of the bruises. In the process, he is lifted by music that feels unabashedly motivational, built to remind us that the best times are hopefully to come.   Perfect Son, it should be said, is Sub Pop’s first Polish artist, the result of an extended interest in Biliński’s work and the country itself from label co-founder Jonathan Poneman. Several years ago, Biliński applied to play at South by Southwest as Coldair.  Poneman saw his performance, and was impressed. The two stayed in touch, with Poneman eventually signing Coldair to a publishing deal. “I bugged him about releasing my stuff constantly,” Biliński admits with a laugh. “And I guess he admired my persistence.”   When  Cast  was finally finished, Poneman didn’t need more convincing. These songs, after all, are magnetic, with the searching harmonies and deep drums of “Promises” and the rhythmic intricacy and serial synths of “Wax” pulling you close on first listen and holding you there for the foreseeable future.

{"title": "Sub Pop To Reissue Green River’s Classic Releases ‘Dry As a Bone’ and ‘Rehab Doll’, Both as Expanded, Deluxe Editions, Worldwide on January 25th, 2019", "date": "THU, NOV 8, 2018 at 659 AM", "preview": "Listen to tracks “This Town” (from  Dry As a Bone ) and “Forever Means” (from  Rehab Doll ). Sub Pop will release  Green River ’s  Dry As a Bone  EP , and their final offering the  Rehab Doll LP , as expanded and remastered deluxe editions on CD/2xLP/DL worldwide January 25th, 2019. Jack Endino served as the executive producer for the project excavating & restoring tapes, mixing, remixing & mastering both packages. Rolling Stone  had this to say of  Rehab Doll : “Proto-grunge at its best, its mud-dipped tracks breaking down and building themselves back up in real time. Frontman Mark Arm (later of Mudhoney) sounds like he gargled with lye before cutting tracks like the boogie-gone-bad “Together We’ll Never,” while the band’s rip-roaring cover of David Bowie’s “Queen Bitch” (originally only available on the album’s cassette release) hints at the wry humor that would animate much of the Seattle scene’s best moments.” And  Magnet Magazine  offers this, “Not only did Green River exemplify the collision of punk, metal and classic rock that became the early Seattle sound’s calling card, it eventually spawned some of the most recognizable faces of the grunge era….Green River sound is exactly what you would expect, with the tension of competing styles (Arm’s unhinged, punk-rock shriek vs. Gossard and Ament’s bluesy metal wanking) forming a singular, if combustible, mix….The impact is something akin to a beer bottle to the head, and it still reverberates 20 years later.”   LP preorders of each album through  Sub Pop Mega Mart  and  select independent retailers  will receive the limited Loser editions of  Dry As a Bone  on forest green vinyl and  Rehab Doll  on opaque lime green vinyl (while supplies last). About Green River’s  Dry As a Bone  and  Rehab Doll :  The story of Seattle’s rise to global rock supremacy in the late ’80s and early ’90s begins with  Green River . Made up of Jeff Ament (bass), Mark Arm (guitar/vocals), Bruce Fairweather (guitar), Stone Gossard (guitar), and Alex Shumway (drums), the quintet put out three 12”s and a 7” single during its brief existence. But Green River’s influence on Seattle’s music scene spread far and wide—thanks to the members’ dispersion into bands including Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, and Love Battery, as well as the punk-glam-sludge-rock songs they left behind.  “By ‘83, ‘84, there was definitely a movement that was happening within hardcore, like Black Flag slowing down for  My War ,” says Arm. “The Replacements and Butthole Surfers were rearing their heads, and they’re very different bands, but they’re not hardcore—the Replacements are pretty much straight-up rock, and Butthole Surfers were God knows what. Sonic Youth’s  Bad Moon Rising was around, and a lot of really interesting post-hardcore things were happening, Big Black, Scratch Acid.”  Green River, which formed in 1984, was part of that evolution, with a sound that straddled a lot of different genres—blues, punk, boozy straight-ahead rock. The mini-LP  Dry As A Bone , which came out in 1987, and the LP  Rehab Doll , which came out in 1988, were released as a single CD with a few bonus cuts, including their sneering cover of David Bowie’s “Queen Bitch” and their marauding version of Dead Boys’ “Ain’t Nothin’ to Do,” in 1990—but they’ve been unavailable on vinyl for years. Now, these slices of Seattle music history are not only back in print, they’re accompanied by items from the from the vaults that had been forgotten about for decades.    Dry As A Bone , originally released as a mini-LP, was recorded at Jack Endino’s Reciprocal Recording in 1986, and it shows the band in furious form, with Arm’s yowl battling Fairweather and Gossard’s ferocious guitar playing on “This Town” and “Unwind” opening as a slow bluesy grind then jump-starting itself into a hyperactive chase. The deluxe edition includes Green River’s cuts from the crucial Seattle-scene compilation  Deep Six , as well as long-lost songs that were recorded to the now-archaic format Betamax. “Jack actually got his hands on one of those old players and was able to revive and mix them,” says Arm.

The album, recorded largely at Seattle’s Steve Lawson Studios, bridges the gap between the taut, punky energy of  Dry As a Bone  and the bigger drums and thicker riffs that were coming to dominate rock in the late ’80s. “None of us had been in a 24-track studio at that point,” says Arm. “There were a lot of weird things that we did in the recording of  Rehab Doll  that we had never done in any other studio. I remember doing the vocals for ‘One More Stitch’ underneath a piano that had its strings mic’d—so I was singing and that was being recorded, but the reverberation from the strings was being recorded at the same time.” Rehab Doll  includes the menacing “Forever Means,” which front-loads Arm’s yelp amidst waterspouts of guitar and a swaggering rhythm section, the cavernous “One More Stitch,” and “Swallow My Pride,” which would go on to be covered by fellow Sub Pop outfits Soundgarden and The Fastbacks. This new edition of  Rehab Doll  includes a remixed version of the album + 8 songs recorded to 8-track at Endino’s Reciprocal Recording, which features a more accurate depiction of how the band sounded when they played live. (“We generally didn’t have a gated snare sound,” notes Arm.) “When I listen to these mixes, I think, ‘This is how we actually sounded—this is the kind of energy we had,’” says Shumway. “It’s much more raw, and it’s much more real.” Rehab Doll Tracklisting 1.

Fans of a more youthful age may remember the second and third editions, which ran from 1998-2002 and 2008-2009, respectively, and together included hitmakers like Iron and Wine, Bright Eyes, The White Stripes, Death Cab for Cutie, Jesus and Mary Chain, The Get Up Kids, The Dutchess and the Duke, Om, Thee Oh Sees, and many more.    All of this ancient history is to say:  1.

We will be traversing the snowy landscape wearing our finest shades of sunshine to try and bring a little light to the gloom! Our last tour focused mainly on the new album, but for this one we’ll be busting out some older jams and hopefully trying out some all new things. And yes, there will be Space Horn.” (full list of dates below). In tandem with this announcement, King Tuff has released a cover of the classic ABBA song “S.O.S.” via the Amazon Original series. About the song: “‘S.O.S.’ is a really sad song if you actually listen to the lyrics, but like a lot of ABBA songs you don’t notice because the music is so fun and uplifting. My heart has had kind of a rollercoaster of a year so it made sense to cover this song, slow it down, and swim around in the beautiful sadness of it.”   Amazon Music listeners can simply say, “Alexa, play King Tuff’s  “S.O.S.’”  in the Amazon Music app for iOS and Android and on Alexa-enabled device.

Upon its release in 2008, the record was warmly received from critics and fans alike. MAGNET named it one of the “Top 25 Albums of 2008,” and raved, “Keep Your Eyes Ahead is a shining example of how to go retro while still moving forward.” Washington Post offered this, “Trading its former album’s dense keyboard compositions for a more expansive and organic sound, Keep Your Eyes Ahead is the work of a band commanding its audience’s attention. Stand out tracks like “Hallelujah” and “Can’t Say No” show the band flexing its melodic muscles, branching out into grandiose guitar rock territory without sacrificing the nuance and keyboard flourishes of its early work.” And Drowned in Sound, in its 8/10 review of the album, had this to say, “And now, at last, the protracted silence is broken by the surging scream of Keep Your Eyes Ahead, an album that feels as vital as the first, gulping breath of the near drowned. What this record means to Summers and partner Benjamin Weikel is apparent in the intense force of feeling.”"},

Then was the slow process of finding the other pieces to fit. The song is a platonic love song. It offers no answers. Just says, ‘Hi, I see you.’” The band’s sophisticated debut album has been embraced by lovers of their early EPs,  Talk Tight  and The French Press, and new fans alike.

Here’s a statement from Robin Pecknold on this upcoming release: “ Over the years many people have asked if we’d ever release our original demo EP in any form, or if the Sun Giant EP would ever have its own vinyl sleeve, or they would ask why the font on the cover of the Fleet Foxes LP was so large, or they would ask if there were any other recordings, b-sides or rarities from that time period, or if there were 32 pages worth of old photos and ephemera that they could take a look at, and they would often ask if all of these things could be packaged together, as a First Collection, four pieces of 12” and 10” vinyl, fresh pressings in freshly designed sleeves, packaged together in a beautiful duo-tone bookcloth box with a magnetic clasp hinge: to the thousands of you who have asked for this very weirdly specific thing, it comes out   November 9th  (with CD / Digital versions available as well), thanks for the good idea. ” TRACKLISTING:   Fleet Foxes  12” Side A 1.

In receiving Bhai Vir Singh’s response by way of a familiar female form, he journeys to ready himself to meet her on H.E.R. terms by way of cleanliness, and a non-deity based ritual.

The Band Will Perform ‘Furr’ In Its Entirety On Tour This Fall", "date": "FRI, SEP 14, 2018 at 930 AM", "preview": "Blitzen Trapper ’s  Furr :  Deluxe Edition  is now available worldwide through Sub Pop. You can now hear the new version in its entirety at  Spotify  and  Apple Music .     Recently,  Rolling Stone Country  had this to say about “Booksmart Baby,” one of the rarities found on  Furr: Deluxe Edition , “Different from the hazy, psychedelic Americana of  Furr …“Booksmart Baby” is a mellow, finger-picked folk tune that runs for just under two minutes. The song…sounds in line with the wistful melancholy of Nick Drake and that of another Portland artist, Elliott Smith. Throughout the short song, Blitzen Trapper frontman Eric Early delivers hushed, cryptically poetic lyrics full of longing.”   Blitzen Trapper released  Furr  its breakthrough and label debut for Sub Pop in 2008. The album was met with universal acclaim, earning praise from the likes of  The Guardian, Pitchfork, Paste, AV Club , and  Rolling Stone , who in its 4-star review called it “an engaging album full of rootsy beauty.” The album would go on to earn the no. 13 spot on  Rolling Stone ’s “50 Best Albums of 2008,” later that year.   For the newly expanded deluxe edition of  Furr , Blitzen Trapper have compiled two LPs worth of material: The original album and twelve rare and previously unreleased tunes. All of these songs were from the same recordings that became  Furr , with the exception of the “Live at KCRW “ tracks, which were recorded during the  Furr  tour.     The reissue features updated cover art, and a new liner note from Earley reflecting on the album and what it means now, as well as a track by track description of the bonus songs, and a Q&A with the stage & screen actor, and Blitzen Trapper fan, Rainn Wilson (of The Office, Six Feet Under and  The Blitzen Trapper Massacre  fame).

The group’s bio refers to the hazy “Low Key” as a “radiant daydream,” and Blunt takes that concept in an impenetrably nebulous direction [see  September 13th post ].”   1  Time Mirage  is out today on CD/LP/DL/CS worldwide from Sub Pop. The long-player features the highlights  “Give You Game,” “Seven Wheel Motion,” “My Dreams Never Sleep” “Light Up Ahead (Time Mirage)” and the aforementioned “Low Key.” The album also includes guest appearances from labelmates Shabazz Palaces and Porter Ray, along with Stas THEE Boss, OCnotes, Thaddillac, El Mizell, Marquetta Miller, Gerald Turner, and Darrius Willrich.  1 Time Mirage  was produced by Ishmael Butler and Erik Blood at Protect and Exalt: A Black Space in Seattle.   Spotify (Album Stream):   spoti.fi/2x7rBql Apple Music (Album Stream):   apple.co/2tf7AMF London in Stereo  says  1 Time Mirage  is “[A] spellbinding fusion of rap, blessed funk, and tough soul, and  The Wire  called it a “suite of sci-fi cosmic hip-hop that takes myriad turns and twists, none of them predictable, all of them compelling.”  Meanwhile,  Loud and Quiet , in its 8/10 review, had this say, “Like Butler’s frequent collaborator Flying Lotus, Knife Knights create a rich, fibrous world around each of the tracks on  1 Time Mirage . This is an album whose air you can breathe, whose fragrant musk seeps from each detail. Its production has an insomniac energy, oddly tranquil and unsettled at the same time, each dab of reverb and tickling delay sending ripples through the fug of warped beats and sardonic rhymes.”    And  Bandcamp Daily  offered this,  “1 Time Mirage  leapfrogs across several different genres and subgenres, pulling hip-hop, psychedelic soul, and shoegaze into an 11-track set of chaotic noise. Between the woozy bounce of “Seven Wheel Motion,” the house-inflected stomp of “Can’t Draw The Line,” and the hazy pop of “Come On Let’s Go,” the album is easily as esoteric as anything created by Shabazz Palaces; but the music here feels lusher and more sophisticated.”   1 Time Mirage  purchases through  megamart.subpop.com  and  select independent retailers  will receive the limited Loser edition pressed on blue and white marbled vinyl (while supplies last).  The album cover also features gorgeous artwork from  Robert Beatty ."},

And now the song has a new, kaleidoscopic video directed by album co-producer Sonic Boom.  Upon the album’s release,  Stereogum  included the track in its “5 Best Songs of the Week,” and had this to say: “The immediate standout from Beach House’s magnificent  7  is “Drunk In LA,” a showstopper made stronger by everything else around it. The stuttering opening beat that opens the song blossoms into one of the duo’s most staggering songs yet.”  Beach House has also delivered a new Sonic Boom remix of “Black Car” [ listen here ] and had this to say about both the rework, and the “Drunk In LA” video:   “ 7   was co-produced by Sonic Boom aka Peter Kember. We had a lot of fun with him throughout the process, and he helped us remember that any idea is welcome in a recording environment (he played a drill on “Lemon Glow”).    “While mixing the record with Alan Moulder in London, we were out having dinner and Pete mentioned an idea for a video where the viewer is always looking up from the ground. This became the “Drunk in LA” video. When he sent it to us, we complimented and commented on the trippy, dreamlike nature of the video and he wrote that it was essentially just a day in his life.   “We have never had a remix, but we thought it would be cool if Pete did one. We really like the one he did for “Black Car,” because it feels like a different song, focused largely on voice and arpeggio. It feels like a poem this way, and the minimal treatment highlights the lonesome quality of the song. Hope you enjoy!

Throughout a catalog that spans 12 studio albums, another dozen or so EPs, a Christmas record that’s justly become a classic, and countless one-offs, it’s upended its formulas constantly while still sounding unmistakably like itself. On the new  Double Negative , those patterns hold true amid Low’s most radical reinvention yet…Low throws itself into what often sounds like an inversion of its classic sound. “Quorum” opens Double Negative  with static-scarred loops that curdle and crunch menacingly, setting a fresh scene with maximum efficiency: This is the sound of beauty as it’s distorted to the point of disintegration [ listen here ].”  [Album Cover Image by Peter Liversidge] Pre-orders of  Double Negative  through  megamart.subpop.com  and  select independent retailers  will receive the limited Loser Edition on crystal clear vinyl with an enclosed full-color flat of the album’s front cover artwork (while supplies last).

Husband/Wife duo Heroux and Zambri have always dipped in and out of each other’s creative spaces, advising on their respective outputs and supporting one another. But never had they before completely committed to doing an entire album as a duo, sharing an equal load. The time had come. And thank goodness. They have dreamed up a record packed with the tension, chaos and beauty of a fluid and cathartic two-way conversation. In a universe increasingly threatening our abilities to work hard on communication and coexistence, their creative union isn’t just inspired but important. “Why did it take us so long?” laughs Heroux.   Live, Mass Gothic expands to a four-piece with multi-instrumentalist Cristi Jo Zambri and drummer Joe Stickney, who also play on the album.  ITYLE  was co-produced by the band and Josh Ascalon, mixed by Chris Coady and mastered by Heba Kadry.   What The People are saying about Mass Gothic: “Backed by luminous synths and chugging momentum, the intimacy of the hook is blown up to thrilling proportions, and their love is scattered large across the soundscape.”[J.Z.O.K.] -  The 405    “Essential…Their earworm-ready songs are made to fight for their right to party.” -  Loud and Quiet   “Mass Gothic’s identity is nearly undefinable, with the pair blasting through genres and ideals with a sort of unsettled energy. Whether losing yourself to the starry synths and complimentary vocals found in the spacey fuzz of “J.Z.O.K.” or floating off in the dazzling airiness, throbbing rhythms and vast instrumental expanse of the album’s title track, the release is one sure to keep you enraptured.” -  The Grey Estates “A compelling listen…a record worthy of your time.” -  Bristol Live"},
{"title": "Iron & Wine’s ‘Weed Garden’ Is Out Today + North American Fall Tour Dates Run September 21st Through November 17th", "date": "FRI, AUG 31, 2018 at 900 AM", "preview": "Iron & Wine ’s  Weed Garden   arrives as a six-song collection of all new material, whose roots were planted during the making of last years Grammy-nominated,  Beast Epic.   The release is being made available worldwide from Sub Pop and joins the ranks of his previous EP’s - The Sea and Rhythm ,  Woman King   and  In the Reins   which contains some of Iron & Wine’s most beloved material.   [ Album Art Paintings by Sam Beam ] Recorded earlier this year at The Loft in Chicago,  Weed Garden  features the single “What Hurts Worse” and the fan favorite, “Waves of Galveston,” which first appeared as part of  The Onion’s AV Club  “State Songs” and is finally making its official release. Galveston is just a short trip from Austin where Sam Beam lived for a number years, and its coastal beauty is brought to life in this late summer breezy acoustic number that harkens back to some of Iron & Wine’s earliest material.     Beam recently stated that “‘Waves of Galveston” was one of those songs that had a more reflective feel and I knew I wanted to do it as an acoustic thing.  I guess it pointed me in the direction of where the rest of  Beast Epic  went.” He also touched on the EP format and noted that he “really like(s) short records. The more concise the better. Anytime you have fewer things to absorb you observe and listen to it differently. It’s a concentrated statement”.    The  Associated Press  had this say of  Weed Garden , “Beam’s surprise gift is the exquisite “Waves of Galveston,” a fan favorite getting its first official release. Its very 70’s-sounding refrain caresses the eardrums and Nick Drake may have sounded like this if singing about Texas….There are plenty of references to nature — the sea, butterflies, serpents, rain, clouds, flowers, winds and waves — but it’s all related to the human experience and the final three songs sustain the theme. Especially affecting are the gorgeous “Autumn Town Leaves” and the increasingly intense and desperate closer “Talking to Fog.”  Weed Garden  is both a wonderful bonus in relation to  Beast Epic and an enchanting collection that deserves to be valued for its own plentiful merits.”    And  NPR Music  offers this, “Not only is  Weed Garden  a consistently powerful extension of  Beast Epic , but it also marks the first studio release of one of Beam’s live staples: “Waves of Galveston.” That outtake has been cropping up in performances…but it benefits enormously from a new full-band arrangement that’s crisp and lovely, spare but sweet.”   Weed Garden  is available on CD/LP/DL/CS through Sub Pop  over here .

Eric Early says of the song, “One of those weird haunting songs I wrote in the middle of the night in the telegraph building on the poppy couch, those lyrics are some kind of riddle I think. Blitzen Trapper released  Furr  its breakthrough and label debut for Sub Pop in 2008. The album was met with universal acclaim, earning praise from the likes of The Guardian, Pitchfork, Paste, AV Club, and Rolling Stone, who in it’s 4 star review called it “an engaging album full of rootsy beauty.” The album would go on to earn the no. 13 spot on Rolling Stone’s “50 Best Albums of 2008,” later that year. For the newly expanded deluxe edition of  Furr , Blitzen Trapper have compiled two LPs worth of material: The original album and twelve rare and previously unreleased tunes.

The newly remastered set will be available on CD/2xLP/DL and includes the original 10-song effort along with a second album of demos, alternate versions, and outtakes from the same era.  Keep Your Eyes Ahead: Deluxe Edition  was mastered by The Helio Sequence at  Helio Sound  studio in their hometown of Portland, Oregon.  You can listen to  “Lately”  and an acoustic version of  “No Regrets”  and  pre-order  the record today.   Upon its release in 2008, the record was warmly received from critics and fans alike.  MAGNET  named it one of the “Top 25 Albums of 2008,” and raved, “ Keep Your Eyes Ahead  is a shining example of how to go retro while still moving forward.”  Washington Post  offered this, “Trading its former album’s dense keyboard compositions for a more expansive and organic sound,  Keep Your Eyes Ahead  is the work of a band commanding its audience’s attention. Stand out tracks like “Hallelujah” and “Can’t Say No” show the band flexing its melodic muscles, branching out into grandiose guitar rock territory without sacrificing the nuance and keyboard flourishes of its early work.” And  Drowned in Sound , in its 8/10 review of the album, had this to say, “And now, at last, the protracted silence is broken by the surging scream of  Keep Your Eyes Ahead , an album that feels as vital as the first, gulping breath of the near drowned.

The strongest and most assured record of their \r\ncareer. The songs dig deep emotionally – but critically their aesthetics\r\n are well-balanced, the voice and instruments perfectly calibrated. \r\nWhile its predecessors had a tendency for introspection,  Sculptor  is wide open.” [8/10] -  Uncut \r\n  \r\n“… Sculptor , the Australians’ self-produced follow-up to 2014’s wonderful  Passerby , also broadens Luluc’s palette and subject matter in rewarding ways.” [First Listen] -  NPR Music \r\n  \r\n“Ultimately, the album repays careful and repeated attention, its varied\r\n qualities cohering effectively with a measured sense of control that, \r\nsimultaneously, offers positive indications of the considerable \r\npotential for future even more diverse arrangements.” [8/10] -  The Line of Best Fit \r\n  \r\n “ Zoe Randell and Steve Hassett are back with an album that \r\ncomplicates their modest aesthetic. The lyrical wrestling and sonic \r\nexploration nearly betrays their earliest work yet elevates their \r\ncatalog—already so celebrated—to another level…  Sculpto r is an album that feels important.” [8/10] -  Under the Radar \r\n  \r\n“ Sculptor  is a small gift coming at the right time, a 36-minute reverie that nonetheless remains rooted in waking life.” -  PopMatters \r\n  \r\n“ Sculptor  yields center-stage to Randell’s haiku-like celebrations of human spirit and suburban transcendence.” [4/5] -  MOJO \r\n  \r\n“Randall and Hassett have made a record that boldly turns a corner while\r\n still slotting neatly into their already sterling catalog.” [4/5] -  All Music \r\n \r\n“Randell’s lyrics reveal subversiveness too, telling of teenage \r\ninsurrections and small-town upsets. Steve Hassett’s backing, meanwhile,\r\n is characterized by enough strange impulses and pleasing deviations to \r\nwhirr and rattle through the stillness. The band’s third album is filled\r\n with such quirks and quiet rebellions.”  [4/5] -  Q Magazine"},

Everything She Said The time is now to follow J Mascis everywhere in the galaxy, starting with jmascis.com and also  Spotify  |  Apple  |  Bandcamp  |  Facebook  |  Twitter  |  Instagram  | and here on  subpop.com . [Photo Credit:  Cara Totman]    \r\n About Elastic Days : \r\nNear the end of Reagan’s first term, the Western Massachusetts Hardcore \r\nscene coughed up an insanely shaped chunk called Dinosaur. Comprised of \r\nWMHC vets, the trio was a miasmic tornado of guitar noise, bad attitude \r\nand near-subliminal pop-based-shape-shifting. The contours of their \r\nsound ebbed and flowed and mutated for 13 years before the name was \r\nretired. And in the course of that time, Dinosaur (amended to Dinosaur \r\nJr. for legal reasons) defined a very specific, very aggressive set of oblique song-based \r\nresponses to what was going on. Their one constant was the \r\nscalp-fryingly loud guitar and deeply buried vocals of J Mascis.  \r\n  \r\nA couple of years before they ended their reign, J cut a solo album called  Martin + Me .\r\n Recorded live and acoustic, the record allowed the bones of J’s songs \r\nto be totally visible for the first time. Fans were surprised to hear \r\nhow melodically elegant these compositions were, even if J still seemed \r\ninterested in swallowing some of the words that most folks would have \r\nsung. Since then, through the reformation of the original Dinosaur Jr \r\nlineup in 2005, J has recorded solo albums now and then, when he had \r\nsongs that were suited to acoustic (or at least relatively toned-down) \r\nperformance. And those album,  Sings + Chant for AMMA  (2005),  Several Shades of Why  (2011) and  Tied to a Star (2014) all delivered incredible sets of songs presented with a minimum of bombast and a surfeit of cool.  \r\n  \r\nLike its predecessors,  Elastic Days was recorded at J’s own Bisquiteen studio. Mascis does almost all his own stunts, although Ken Miauri (who also appeared on  Tied to a Star )\r\n plays keyboards and there are a few guest vocal spots. These include \r\nold mates Pall Jenkins (Black Heart Procession), and Mark Mulcahy \r\n(Miracle Legion, etc.), as well as the newly-added voice of Zoë Randell \r\n(Luluc), among others. But the show is mostly J’s and J’s alone. \r\n  \r\nHe laughs when I tell him I’m surprised by how melodic his vocals seem \r\nto have gotten. Asked if that was intentional, he says, “No. I took some\r\n singing lessons and do vocal warm-ups now, but that was mostly just to \r\nkeep from blowing out my vocal cords when Dino started touring again. \r\nThe biggest difference with this record might have to do with the drums.\r\n I’d just got a new drum set I was really excited about. I don’t have \r\ntoo many drum outlets at the moment, so I played a lot more drums than \r\nI’d originally planned. I just kept playing. [laughs] I’d play the \r\nacoustic guitar parts then head right to the drums.” \r\n  \r\nThere is plenty of drumming on the dozen songs on  Elastic Days .\r\n But for those expecting the hallucinatory overload of Dinosaur Jr’s \r\nlive attack, the gentleness of the approach here will draw easy \r\ncomparisons to Neil Young’s binary approach to working solo versus \r\nworking with Crazy Horse. This is a lazy man’s shorthand, but it still \r\nrings true. \r\n  \r\nJ’s vocals have always leaned in a direction acknowledging the Bard of \r\nToronto, but as early as Dinosaur Jr’s third single, the epoch-defining \r\n“Freak Scene,” J’s off-hand vocal delivery was instantly recognizable. \r\nOn a track like “Sky Is All We Had,” the same dynamism is at work, but \r\nthe evolution of technique is so massive as to lift the proceedings to a\r\n new level. The album is chock-full of similar nuggets. Built around \r\nacoustic guitar figures, often holding off electric flights of guitar \r\nbackdrop until the third act, the tunes are massively seductive and \r\nsatisfying. J’s fave track is “ See You At The Movies,” which has a fully\r\n evolved sense of loss hanging over it, and features the classic \r\ncouplet, “I don’t peak too early/I don’t peak at all.”  My own choice is\r\n “Picking Out the Seeds,” on which J pulls out his falsetto voice to \r\ngreat effect, and maintains a middlin’ pace that makes the tune one of \r\nthe great Beard Rock readymades of the era.  \r\n  \r\nBut  Elastic Days brims with great moments: Epic hooks that snare\r\n you in surprisingly subtle ways, guitar textures that slide against \r\neach other like old lovers, and structures that range from a \r\nneo-power-ballad (“Web So Dense”) to jazzily-canted West Coasty \r\npost-psych (“Give It Off”) to a track that subliminally recalls the \r\nkeyboard approach of Scott Thurston-era Stooges (“Drop Me”). The album \r\nplays out with a combination of holism and variety that is certain to \r\nset many brains ablaze. \r\n \r\nJ says he’ll be taking this album on the road later in the year. He’ll \r\nbe playing by himself, but unlike other solo tours he says he’ll be \r\nstanding up this time. “I used to just sit down and build a little fort \r\naround myself – amps, music stands, drinks stands, all that stuff. But I\r\n just realized it sounds better if the amps are higher up because I’m so\r\n used to playing with stacks. So I’ll stand this time.” \r\n  \r\nI ask if it’s not pretty weird to stand alone on a big stage. “Yeah,” he\r\n says. “But it’s weird sitting down too.” Ha. Good point. One needs to \r\nbe elastic. In all things. \r\n  \r\n –Byron Coley"},

Omori’s rediscovered life’s \r\ngood side, and found more of himself in the process; ultimately, that’s \r\nled to him being able to pour a whole lot more of his heart and soul \r\ninto his songs, and it’s a beautiful thing (8/10).”  Pitchfork  offered\r\n this, “The former Smith Westerns member’s second album represents a \r\nreturn to his core strengths: crystalline, cosmically ornate melodies \r\nand wryly clear-eyed lyrics.” And  PopMatters  raves, “The resulting sound is inventive, fun, fresh, and perhaps Omori’s best release to-date (8/10).” \r\n \r\n The Diet  is available now through  Sub Pop .\r\n  LP purchases through megamart.subpop.com and select independent \r\nretailers will receive the limited Loser edition on lavender swirl vinyl\r\n (while supplies last).

Also much like Sonic Youth, every member writes and sings, and it all amalgamates perfectly. Guitarist/singer Sarah Hardiman’s rollicking “FFS,” perhaps about the strain of relationships whilst rockin’ (“I see my name up in lights / I see my name but the words are not nice… I feel like a fool / Out playing pool, hitting on you”) crashes into bassist Lee Parker’s “Metal Carnage.” Deaf Wish also know their way around a closer—“Smoke,” by drummer Daniel Twomey, sung by Twomey and Hardiman, is one of the year’s hookier indie-noise thunder-rolls. Deaf Wish remain kings of the daydream nation.” [Album of the Day] -  Bandcamp   “FFS” feels like a flame war, a tense pyre to keeping your friends close and your enemies closer.” - Stereogum   “Straightforward and immensely satisfying three-chord garage punk…” -  The Guardian “It’s a boom time for Aussie aggro bands and here’s another corker.

Mr. President [ Photo Credit: Justin Henning ]   Knife Knights were born of the love of mystery.   A decade ago, Ishmael Butler—the architect of the groundbreaking but long-disbanded hip-hop group Digable Planets—was preparing at last to emerge from years of near-complete silence. He unveiled his new outlet, Shabazz Palaces, in the summer of 2009 through a pair of self-released EPs, surrounding his hyperlinked verses with webs of psychedelic textures and refracted rhythms. From the start, confidentiality seemed essential: Butler wanted Shabazz Palaces to stand on its own strength, not his outsized reputation, so he adopted a nom de plume for himself.   As the project’s network expanded, though, he needed new monikers for his partnerships. Knife Knights is the name he gave to his work with Seattle engineer, producer, songwriter, and film composer Erik Blood, a vital force in the Shabazz Palaces universe. Now, after more than a decade of collaboration and the development into of a rich friendship, Butler and Blood have made a proper full-length record together as Knife Knights:  1 Time Mirage , an eleven-track odyssey that finds the pair and a cast of their friends weaving together a singular world of soul and shoegaze, hip-hop and lush noise, bass and bedlam.  1 Time Mirage  represents a playground for Butler and Blood, a free space for unfettered exploration, and a radically adventurous start to something much more than a mere production duo or side project.   Butler and Blood met in 2003 at a Spiritualized show in Seattle, introduced by a mutual friend who was soon set to record Butler in his studio. A Digable Planets zealot, Blood was floored, passing a bootleg copy of  Blowout Comb  to his friend for an autograph (which Butler dutifully provided). For the next few years, they’d run into one another by chance and sometimes make small talk about working together. When Butler finally sent him a few tunes to mix, the kinship seemed obvious and immediate. Though Butler had grown up as a hip-hop student, he’d started absorbing shoegaze rock and ambient soundscapes, too. Blood, meanwhile, was an ardent hip-hop fan who had always been an inclusive listener. On every Shabazz Palaces album, Butler and Blood have delighted at that artistic intersection, constantly indoctrinating hip-hop in new worlds of sound. “He takes my ideas and clarifies and pronounces them, helps me realize them,” explains Butler. “He helps me get to the essence.”   Recorded in three fertile sessions interrupted by Shabazz Palaces tours and Blood’s recording projects,  1 Time Mirage  is a profound fulfilment of that partnership, realized at the crossroads of Butler’s and Blood’s mutual enthusiasms. Their shared interests have been split into pieces and fused together with enviable imagination. Take “Give You Game,” where Butler and Blood weave their distant voices through a landscape of synthesizers and drums that bubble up sporadically, like geysers. Marquetta Miller and THEESatisfaction’s Stasia Irons soon join, their round tones lacing around those sounds and giving them shape. It is an abstract anthem to astral love.   “Low Key” suggests a radiant daydream, with kaleidoscopic synthesizers and faded harmonies pirouetting over puzzle pieces of dizzying percussion and understated funk. “Can’t Draw the Line” rushes headlong like some narcotized disco fantasy, with its four planted firmly on the floor but Butler’s breathy voice and an armada of synthesizers stretching skyward. They splice doo-wop harmonies to scattered dub rhythms during “Light Up Ahead (Time Mirage),” hard-edged verses to industrial din during “ Mr. President.” Colossal drums puncture walls of labyrinthine noise sculpted from deranged synthesizers and mutated guitars during “Seven Wheel Motion,” an absolute powerhouse. Butler seems to rap in dialogue with himself, detailing a threatening streetscape and shaping the experience into personal realizations. “Smooth landings, queens in tandems, cash in grand sums,” he declares at one point. “Life is random/I roll the dice and bet on me.”   In the decade since Butler launched Shabazz Palaces and first christened his partnership with Blood as Knife Knights, much of that project’s external mystery has, of course, fallen away. And  1 Time Mirage  is a very public step forward for the pair. That early sense of secrecy has given way to a spirit of friendship and creative candor, to the doors of experimentation being thrown open by old pals thrilled by the prospect of testing new ideas.   Still, these eleven songs retain a core of intrigue and, indeed, mystery; each listen reveals yet another connection between infinite and interlocking pieces. To wit, Robert Beatty’s brilliant cover for  1 Time Mirage  depicts a futuristic vehicle, being coolly steered with one hand into some great, mildly ominous unknown. That’s how these songs feel, too—confident conquests of the dark that unlock sounds and spaces you have yet to imagine."},

That it’s in a pop-punk setting, with lyrics reckoning with adulthood, only strengthens its power.” -  New York Magazine “full of tough-earned wisdom and egalitarian rage,  Losing  is a high-energy, high-impact emotional workout for everyone involved.” - Wired “The bass hops around nervously in nearly constant eighth notes, with drums syncopated against it à la the Police; a guitar on the left offers a neat new-wave hook while another one on the right grumbles occasionally with dissonant, distorted squawks. And as those tensions flare into multiple little crescendos, the singer Alicia Bognanno gets herself more and more worked up.” -  New York Times “Expect lots more of Bognanno’s sharp, cynical emotional insights and impassioned yells, all backed by Bully’s gnawing, ’90s-inspired sound.”  -  SPIN “The record once again faces down youthful angst, but with a notable growth in Bognanno’s maturity” -  Consequence of Sound “Alicia Bognanno has a way of channeling her inner struggles into tightly-constructed and toiled-over rock songs with a classic touch.” - Stereogum"},

Cullen Omori  has shared the kaleidoscopic closer,  “A Real You,”from his sophomore effort,  The Diet , available worldwide from Sub Pop Records on August 17th. Omori shares that  “ a lot of the parts were scattered around in different songs during the New Misery sessions. The song has been incubated since 2014, and I’d always mess around with a version of the song at sound checks and during interludes in the live set. The song coalesced last year and it came together in a way where it’s familiar but also weird and new and I think that’s a philosophy I applied to the whole album.  You can listen to “A Real You”  here.   The Diet  is a powerful modern indie-rock album that is buoyed by warped, analog pedals/transistors and tailor-made guitar tones. Omori’s winsome vocals crisscross ‘70s art rock and classic songwriting all within the span of 40 minutes.

Messiah’s Lament 10. Next Mass Extinction 11. Oh Yeah [ Photo Credit:  Emily Reiman ] Since the late ’80s, Mudhoney – the Seattle-based foursome whose muck-crusted version of rock, shot through with caustic wit and battened down by a ferocious low end – has been a high-pH tonic against the ludicrous and the insipid.   Thirty years later, the world is experiencing a particularly high-water moment for both those ideals. But just in time, vocalist Mark Arm, guitarist Steve Turner, bassist Guy Maddison, and drummer Dan Peters are back with  Digital Garbage , a barbed-wire-trimmed collection of sonic brickbats. Arm’s raw yawp and his bandmates’ long-honed chemistry make  Digital Garbage  an ideal release valve for the 2018 pressure cooker, its insistent rhythms forcing movement and Arm’s sardonic lyrics offering a funhouse-mirror companion to the ever-more-ridiculous news cycle. “My sense of humor is dark, and these are dark times,” says Arm. “I suppose it’s only getting darker.”   Digital Garbage  opens with the swaggering “Nerve Attack,” which can be heard as a nod both to  modern-life anxiety and the ever-increasing threat of warfare. The album’s title comes from the outro of “Kill Yourself Live,” which segues from a revved-up Arm organ solo into a bleak look at the way notoriety goes viral. “I’m not on social media, so my experience is somewhat limited,” says Arm. “But people really seem to find validation in the likes—and then there’s Facebook Live, where people have streamed torture and murder, or, in the case of Philando Castile, getting murdered by a cop.”   “In the course of writing that song,” he adds, “I thought about how, once you put something out there online, you can’t wipe it away. It’s always going to be there—even if no one digs it up, it’s still out there floating somewhere.”   Appropriately enough, bits of recent news events float through the record—”Please Mr. Gunman,” on which Arm bellows “We’d rather die in church!” over his bandmates’ careening charge, was inspired by a TV-news bubblehead’s response to a 2017 church shooting, while the ominous refrain that opens the submerged-blues of “Next Mass Extinction” calls back to last summer’s clashes in Charlottesville, although Arm’s brutal delivery helps twist it into an indictment. Arm also went back to the pre-Mudhoney era for the titular insult of the stinging “Hey Neanderfuck.” ” National Lampoon made several comedy records in the 70s, and in one skit  someone gets called a ‘Neanderfuck,’” Arm laughs. “I’ve always loved that insult and wondered why it never became a part of the American lexicon—it’s so brutal. It was high time to use that.”   Mudhoney’s core sound—steadily pounding drums, swamp-thing bass, squalling guitar wobble, Arm’s hazardous-chemical voice—remains on  Digital Garbage , which the band recorded with longtime collaborator (and  Digital Garbage  pianist) Johnny Sangster at the Seattle studio Litho. The anti-religiosity shimmy “21st Century Pharisees” builds its case with Maddison’s woozy synths. “It adds a really nice touch to the proceedings,” Arm says of Maddison’s synth parts. “And Guy has really learned his way around his machines playing in a synth trio the past few years.”   The shuffling “Messiah’s Lament” is the band’s first song in 6/8—and it’s told from the point of view of a world-weary Jesus. And  Digital Garbage  closes with “Oh Yeah,” a brief celebration of skateboarding, surfing, biking, and the joy provided by these escape valves. “I would’ve really just loved to write songs about just hanging out on the beach, and going on a nice vacation,” says Arm. “But, you know, that probably doesn’t make for great rock.”   Mudhoney, however, know what does make great rock—and the riffs and fury of  Digital Garbage  will stand the test of time, even if the particulars fade away. “I’ve tried to keep things somewhat universal, so that this album doesn’t just seem like of this time—hopefully some of this stuff will go away,” Arm laughs. “You don’t want to say in the future, ‘Hey, those lyrics are still relevant. Great!’” Mudhoney Tour Dates + Ticket Links Mudhoney will embark on a world tour beginning on Aug. 11th at SPF30, Sub Pop’s FREE 30th Anniversary Festival and Party at Alki Beach in West Seattle.

The band will release new music sometime in the new year, and starting today,  So It Is , the group’s 2017 release, and  That’s It! , their 2013 effort, are both now available digitally from Sub Pop.    At a moment when musical streams are crossing with unprecedented frequency, it’s crucial to remember that throughout its history, New Orleans has been the point at which sounds and cultures from around the world converge, mingle, and resurface, transformed by the Crescent City’s inimitable spirit and joie de vivre. Nowhere is that idea more vividly embodied than in the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, which has held the torch of New Orleans music aloft for more than 50 years, all the while carrying it enthusiastically forward as a reminder that the history they were founded to preserve is  a vibrantly living history.  If you don’t already, now is the time to follow Preservation Hall Jazz Band absolutely everywhere including:   Spotify   |   Apple   |   Facebook   |   Instagram   |   Twitter   |   subpop.com   So It Is   Spotify   /  Apple So It Is  (2017) finds the classic Preservation Hall Jazz Band sound invigorated by a number of fresh influences, not  least  among them the band’s 2015 life-changing trip to Cuba.  A visit to the island, so integral to the evolution of jazz and  New Orleans culture in general, had long  been in the works when  President Obama’s diplomatic opening suddenly allowed for  a more extensive  journey than  had  originally seemed  possible. Producer David Sitek, a founder of art rock innovators TV on the Radio who has helmed projects by Kelis, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Santigold among others, offered both a keen modern perspective and a profound respect for the band’s storied history.  So It Is Tracklisting 1.

Singer Ava Trilling writes the lyrics in New York, guitarist Ben Guterl builds the backbone of music in Ohio. “Taste,” in particular, came from diametrically opposed places in their young love lives…the distance - emotional and physical - doesn’t undercut the dizzying intimacy of the song.”    Forth Wanderers album has earned “Best Albums of 2018 (So Far)” notices from the likes of  Stereogum   and  FLOOD  Magazine . And recently, Ava Trilling was included in  Playboy ’s “Music’s Women of Summer”  feature [ read here ].   Forth Wanderers’ previously announced U.S. summer tour in support of their album begins this Wednesday, June 27th in Richmond, VA at Strange Matter and ends July 18th in Cleveland at Mahall’s Lockeroom. Along the way the band will play with Illuminati Hotties (July 5th-14th).  Following the tour, the band will appear at Shadow of the City in Ashury Park, NJ at Stone Pony on August 28th, and at Philadelphia’s Made in America Festival September 1st and 2nd, 2018.   Jun. 27 - Richmond, VA - Strange Matter Jun. 28 - Carrboro, NC - Cat’s Cradle  Jun. 29 - Atlanta, GA - Masquerade Jun. 30 - New Orleans, LA - Pour Boys Jul. 02 - Dallas, TX - Regal Room Jul. 03 - Austin, TX - Barricuda Jul. 05 - Phoenix, AZ - Rebel Lounge* Jul. 06 - San Diego, CA - House of Blues* Jul. 07 - Los Angeles, CA - The Echo* Jul. 08 - San Francisco, CA - Rickshaw Stop* Jul. 10 - Portland, OR - Doug Fir* Jul. 11 - Seattle, WA - The Vera Project* Jul. 13 - Salt Lake City, UT - Kilby Court* Jul. 14 - Denver, CO - Lost Lake* Jul. 17 - Chicago, IL - Beat Kitchen Jul. 18 - Cleveland, OH - Mahall’s Lockeroom Aug. 28 - Asbury Park, NJ - Stone Pony  Sep. 01-02 - Philadelphia, PA - Made In America Festival   Forth Wanderers was produced and recorded by Cameron Konner in Philadelphia over 5 days in the summer of 2017. The album is available now on CD/LP/CS/DL through Sub Pop [ link here ].     What people have said about Forth Wanderers: “The band inhabits a space that can feel bigger than the sprawling tree-lined streets and byzantine freeways of their local inspiration. Instead, the place Trilling and her bandmates create is more personal, messier, and chaotic. They give musical cues to the growing pains of young adulthood that are relatable but never trite—their songs, like any you might’ve been obsessed with in high school, feel like a mirror held up to the all-consuming triumphs and heartbreaks of your own youth.” [album review] -  Pitchfork   “An indie rock record for the ages” [feature] -  Stereogum   “Blissful” [feature] -  Noisey   “This lot are shooting for the premiership of American indie.” [album review] -  DIY   “These might be some of the most well-crafted rock songs you’ll hear all year long.” [album review] -  NME    “The joyfully raucous Forth Wanderers bears testament to just how well the distance formula is working.” [album review] -  CLASH   “Forth Wanderers is nonetheless a bittersweet and refreshingly candid second record from a band that’s seemingly found its voice.” [album review] -  The Line Of Best Fit   “Throughout it’s bursting with the uncontainable energy of glorious garage rock.” [album review] -  Loud and Quiet   “Vocalist Ava Trilling’s songs are wistful but rarely self-pitying, and ‘Forth Wanderers’ sparkles with a pensive, but optimistic energy.” [album review] -  Dork “By playing to their strengths – creating tousled, jangly indie rock around argumentative lyrics that beg for resolution – Forth Wanderers aptly illustrate when a band is truly in sync.” [album review] -  Gold Flake Paint"},

These dates will follow the band’s European shows in July & August and are in support of their latest release,  Vessel . See below for a full list of shows.   Ever wonder what it would be like to co-write an album with a band? Now you have the chance to find out. Loosely inspired by conceptual artist, Sol LeWitt’s wall drawings, Frankie Cosmos front person, Greta Kline has created An Induced Album. Moved by the idea that LeWitt’s artwork can still be installed in new forms even after his death, Kline sought to create a version of this for her songwriting. “It’s the only thing I’ve ever made that I feel is incomplete until it is out in the world” says Kline. “Releasing recorded music is great, but I have never felt an excitement quite like this one– that once I release this, it really changes what it is. It’s not done until the audience participates, which really excites me (or actually, maybe it’s never “done”). It’s also very out of my control once I release it, unlike a finished recorded album, so that’s scary, but fun.”   You can access all the details to co-pilot your own Frankie Cosmos album at  www.frankiecosmosband.com .

Knife Knights  is a new collaboration from Ishmael Butler and musician/producer Erik Blood. The first offering from the union comes in the form of new [and somewhat NSFW] visual for “Give You Game,” directed by  Justin Henning . On “Give You Game,” Butler and Blood weave their distant voices through a landscape of synthesizers and drums that bubble up sporadically, like geysers. Marquetta Miller and former  THEESatisfaction  member Stasia Irons soon join, their round tones lacing around those sounds and giving them shape. It is an abstract anthem to astral love. “Give You Game” also features a guest appearance from guitarist Thaddillac.   Recorded during fertile sessions interrupted by Shabazz Palaces tours and Blood’s recording projects, “Give You Game” marks an exciting new chapter in the creative partnership, realized at the crossroads of Butler’s and Blood’s mutual enthusiasms.

The “J.Z.O.K.” visual captures both the optimistic and romantic nature of the song and finds members Noel Heroux and Jessica Zambri cavorting through city streets in the wee hours of the night. The video was helmed by returning director Addison Post of  Loroto Productions  (who also helmed Mass Gothic’s “Every Night…” & “Nice Night” visuals). Even when you’re married and you’re best friends and you’ve spent a lifetime collaborating with each other, it’s not often obvious what’s staring you right in the face.  I’ve Tortured You Long Enough  is the tongue-in-cheek title of Mass Gothic’s second album for this reason, among several others.

But never had they before completely committed to doing an entire album as a duo, sharing an equal load. The time had come. And thank goodness. They have dreamed up a record packed with the tension, chaos and beauty of a fluid and cathartic two-way conversation. In a universe increasingly threatening our abilities to work hard on communication and coexistence, their creative union isn’t just inspired but important. “Why did it take us so long?” laughs Heroux.   Live, Mass Gothic expands to a four-piece with  multi-instrumentalistCristi Jo Zambri and drummer Joe Stickney, who also play on the album.  ITYLE  was co-produced by the band and Josh Ascalon, mixed by Chris Coady and mastered by Heba Kadry.     I’ve Tortured You Long Enough  features the aforementioned “J.Z.O.K.,” and the previously released lyric video for “Dark Window” [ see here ], and will be available on CD/LP/DL/CS worldwide August 31st through Sub Pop [ buy here ].

More on Mass Gothic by Eve Barlow: Even when you’re married and you’re best friends and you’ve spent a lifetime (18 years is a lifetime, right?) collaborating with each other, it’s not often obvious what’s staring you right in the face.  I’ve Tortured You Long Enough  is the tongue-in-cheek title of Mass Gothic’s second album for this reason, among several others. Husband/Wife duo Noel Heroux and Jessica Zambri have always dipped in and out of each other’s creative spaces, advising on their respective outputs and supporting one another. But never had they before completely committed to doing an entire album as a duo, sharing an equal load. The time had come. And thank goodness. They have dreamed up a record packed with the tension, chaos and beauty of a fluid and cathartic two-way conversation. In a universe increasingly threatening our abilities to work hard on communication and coexistence, their creative union isn’t just inspired but important. “Why did it take us so long?” laughs Heroux from their home in Queens, New York.   When Heroux put out 2016’s self-titled Mass Gothic record, he was necessarily doing so as a solo entity. Mass Gothic was born as a necessary project for his workings following the aftermath of Hooray For Earth’s end. Plagued by his own insecurities and anxieties, Heroux wasn’t yet ready to deal with putting his trust and confidence into another shared project. He wasn’t in a place to take on the burden of those responsibilities with another individual, especially not an individual so fundamental to his existence. So what changed? He can’t exactly pinpoint when the phrase  I’ve Tortured You Long Enough  came to him. It was before a single song of this record was written. But it became a mantra, almost a premonition. Says Heroux, “It just popped into my head,” explains Heroux. “You can say it to a loved one, or to a friend. Or you could wish someone say it to you. It covers so many bases but it’s taken on extra meaning in the past couple of years while everybody is at each other’s throats; frustrated and confused all the time.”   The most important application of the phrase, however, was upon Heroux himself. He had tortured his own psyche long enough, and was particularly in need of forcing himself out of his comfort zone and letting go of that prior stubbornness. “I’ve struggled greatly with telling myself that I can’t do things, or that things aren’t good enough.” he says. Then in the Fall of 2016 circumstances led him to face his biggest fears head on, because he physically had no other choice. “We rented a small tiny cabin in the middle of nowhere in upstate New York. We put ourselves away and worked on music all day, wondering what it would feel and sound like,” explains Zambri.   It began with Zambri penning the first iterations of ‘Keep On Dying’, a synth-laden call-to-arms that recalls the frantic energy of Animal Collective and the celestial torch-bearing of Bat For Lashes. Zambri had the melody and lyrics, and Noel arranged the chords to finish the song. Then things started snowballing. While the writing may have begun in New York, it relocated to LA while their lives became totally in flux. They threw caution to the wind last January and got rid of their Brooklyn apartment. Not only that, they also purged all their belongings, except the bare bones for making an album: instruments and recording equipment.   They bought a car and lived out of a duffle bag of clothes for an entire year. They drove to LA, lived with their co-producer Josh Ascalon, and wrote and wrote and wrote. “The entire record from start to finish was done without having our own place to live,” marvels Heroux now. “Maybe we wouldn’t have been able to do it if we were anchored at home. We were forced into it. Jess was trying to open me up and if we could have just sat on a couch and thrown on the TV it probably wouldn’t have worked.”   The partnership has distinctly evolved the project’s sound. “Mass Gothic” was a far more diverse debut, and as the most successful debuts do it was just Heroux by himself, throwing a hundred different ideas at the wall. He describes it now as “the hellish sounds” of his own brain. Its follow-up therefore is a far more intentional meeting-of-minds. Their openness to work with one another had to come without rules as neither of them could afford to hold back.   Last Spring, for instance, when they thought they’d done all the work and had a fully mixed album, they realized separately that it had way more potential. While they were preparing to go on tour with Zambri’s sister, Cristi Jo, and her sister’s boyfriend Joseph Stickney, Heroux woke up one morning, turned to Zambri and said: “Oh god, we have to fucking re-record the whole album.” The rehearsals were the equivalent of pre-records, and they knew the tracks could accomplish so much more. Although he was afraid to say it out loud, they both agreed it was what was required.   The final ten days took place in the studio in Brooklyn where they laid it down from start to finish with Rick Kwan (Chris Coady mixed the record and Heba Kadry mastered it). “It was too pristine before,” says Zambri. “We wanted it to be perfect but it wasn’t breathing. Even if there would be tension, we wanted it to flow like water.” On that front they’ve achieved a remarkable arc. Bookended by the tracks ‘Dark Window’ and ‘Big Window’, it begins from a place of uncertainty, overwhelming disquiet and self-doubt, and it works towards a feeling greater than the individual. Via an optimistic number of romantic love songs (‘Call Me’, ‘J.Z.O.K.’, ‘How I Love You’) the record basks in the acceptance of co-dependence. Even though the works are intensive, there’s an element of ease to their overall message. The chords and beats may feel squeezed and claustrophobic at times, but expansive guitar tones and electronics allow the listener to deep dive into a chasm of potential.   “Overall it’s a conversation between the two of us,” explains Zambri. It isn’t autobiographical to the point of alienating its listener though.  It’s important that the songs provoke. It’s a record that concludes with the comfort in knowing that you can be both independent and successful in a relationship, which speaks quite literally of the pairs’ experience giving in to this process with one another."},

At that time, it was a record that captured exactly where the band’s frontman, Eric Earley, found himself, both literally and metaphorically, geographically and existentially. Not that the Portland-based musician actually remembers much about the creation of the record’s 13 intriguing, spellbinding songs. Or, more specifically, what its songs actually mean, either now or then. Instead,  Furr , stands as a kind of tribute and elegy to the city that inspired it, but that, a decade later, no longer exists.   “What I was trying to do with those recordings,” explains Earley, “was capture this kind of atmosphere that I was feeling and which pervaded the city at that time. I think I was attempting to capture what Portland was at the time and what it felt like to me. That city is gone now. Old Portland, we call it, but Old Portland has disappeared. But this record gives me the feeling of those times and this city— when it was poor and dumpy and really drug-addled. And it also captures the magic of the outlying rural areas that has slowly changed as well.”   That magic can be heard in each of these songs, and while the city may have vanished from sight – replaced by a newer, richer, shinier and bigger version of itself – its elegance and fractured beauty is preserved within the bones of this record. These songs exist as vivid snapshots of that time, ones that recall the city as it was. At the same time – and while Earley insists he was only trying to capture what Portland was at the time – there’s a mythology within the lyrics and the music, an imagined, semi-fictional vision of Portland and the Pacific Northwest, a kind of parallel universe to the one that actually exists.   “Back then, the city was this really weird place,” says Earley. “It was really bizarre. Weird stuff would happen. And it was much poorer and much smaller. It wasn’t as structured and rich as it is now. It was a totally different place. That’s why it’s funny when people talk about Portland – I’m like well, if you didn’t live here back then you’ll never experience what that was like but if you listen to this record you’ll get a little taste of it. So in that sense, it feels very real and non-mythical to me.”   That said, that doesn’t mean these songs are all based in reality. There are glimpses of God – and of American Christianity – throughout them, not least in the mournful folk narrative of “Black River Killer” and “God & Suicide.” The former is a made-up tale about an anonymous murderer on a killing spree which Earley cites as being about “the mindless violence that Americans consume every single day – in film and books and everything – and what does it mean for us to consume that content and make it a part of us?” The latter is a shimmering, more upbeat track that’s an attempt to commit to tape an ineffable feeling that Earley felt within him but which, after all these years, he’s still unable to pinpoint exactly.   “I can’t tell you what that song’s about,” he says. “I know what it feels like, but I don’t know what it actually literally means. But the words and the music gave me this feeling as I was writing it that made sense at the time. I feel like there’s a feeling of longing that accompanies this record somehow, and there’s this weird longing to be set free. I feel that’s what kind of pervades this record – a melancholic longing for something that we can’t obtain. In “God & Suicide” it’s almost like—and it’s me obviously—but it’s almost like whoever is saying those words is saying to himself ‘Well I’ve got two choices. Either I kill myself or I somehow make my peace with whatever God is.”   Not all the songs have such existential explanations. The soft acoustic jangle of the title track is full of wistful longing, while the plaintive, poignant piano of “Not Your Lover” is a forlorn love – or loss of love – song full of tender sadness. That’s one of a few songs that wouldn’t actually exist had the band—completed at the time by Brian Adrian Koch (drums, vocals), Michael Van Pelt (bass), Erik Menteer (guitar, Moog), Drew Laughery (keyboards) and Marty Marquis (guitar, vocals, melodica)—not found an old warped piano in the hallway of Sally Mack’s School Of Dance, the Portland building which housed the band’s studio. Needless to say, the discovery definitely helped shape the direction of the record.   “That song,” says Earley, “wouldn’t exist, I don’t think, without that piano. I remember sitting at that thing when I first pulled it in and tinkering with it and just sort of writing that one right away. So it probably would have been a slightly different record. A lot of the songs I wrote on piano and I wouldn’t have because I didn’t have one.”   That’s also partly because Earley admits he wasn’t trying to write an album at that time, but write songs to perfect the recording technique he’d been honing when making the band’s previous full-length, 2007’s  Wild Mountain Nation . As such, around three albums’ worth of material was recorded during the sessions for Furr, and it’s a selection of those that comprise the bonus material for this anniversary edition of the record. From the dulcet, chugging tones of “War Is Placebo” to the carefree, summer whimsy of “Ballad Of Bird Love”—a song driven by that same piano—and the melancholy folk tale waltz of “On My Way To The Bay”, the ten outtakes included here offer even further insight into Earley’s creative mindset and the feeling—whatever it is, exactly—that sits at the center of these songs. Written largely between the hours of 11pm and the morning—something that was possible because, in between tours, Earley was living in the studio building— Furr  is a very nocturnal album, full of the wonder and the mystery of the night.   Perhaps surprisingly, given the fact Earley wasn’t trying to make a record per se,  Furr —is an impressively cohesive album, and its counterpart bonus tracks are as well. Much of that is down to Earley’s fastidious recording techniques, using old analogue equipment to create a sound that was inherently nostalgic but also, at the time, anyway, entirely unusual.   “At the time,” he says, “I was going for a very specific sound. And it’s funny, because it’s a sound that you hear so much nowadays—bands have this recording aesthetic that’s very, very lo-fi and almost exactly what I was doing back then, but I was doing it with machinery that was meant to do that as opposed to bands now, who are doing it with modern digital plug-ins. At the time, I was just making what I’d like to hear and I didn’t know if anyone else will like it. It sounds old and distorted—the sound I’d hear in my head when riding my bike around town at 2 in the morning.”   Those days (and nights) may have faded into the past, but they’re very much present within the fabric of  Furr.  A decade on, they sound just as magical and mystical. Not, of course, that the band is just relying on the past glory of this record. Far from it. A decade on from the release of  Furr , has released five more critically acclaimed and achingly beautiful records. The band hasn’t loosened its ambitions, either. In 2017, the band put together  Wild And Reckless  a full-production theater event that ran for a month at Portland’s Center Stage theater and which also spawned last year’s full-length of the same name. There are plenty of plans for the future in the works, too. But for now, just for a little while, it’s time to revel in the joy and sorrow of a time and place that no longer exists—except of course, in a few hearts and minds, and in these wonderfully wistful songs."},

Emma Elizabeth Tillman directs and Josh Tillman stars in the new  Father John Misty  video for “ God’s Favorite Customer ,” the title track from his acclaimed new album. The new visual for the song (which features a glorious duet with Sub Pop labelmate Weyes Blood) finds Tillman wandering the dark, early morning streets of New York City.   God’s Favorite Customer  is one of the best-reviewed albums of the year, earning “Best Albums of the Year (So Far)” notices from the likes of  Rolling Stone ,  Stereogum , and  Consequence of Sound .     Pitchfork  gave the album “Best New Music” status (8.5/10) and said, “He has the ear of Jeff Lynne and the vowels of Elton John as he casts his words into the sky and lets them hang there to be marveled at, plainspoken and myth-free.”   Rolling Stone  offered this, In its piano-ballad gait, baroque-pop raptures and confessional sting, Josh Tillman’s fourth album as the darkly antic Father John Misty often sounds like it was made more than 40 years earlier under yet another name: John Lennon. It’s as if Tillman wrote and arranged these songs under the sumptuous, despairing spell of Lennon’s early-Seventies solo records, with time off for the late-Sixties Zombies and the Beach Boys’ Sunflower (4/5).”   Entertainment Weekly  adds, “God’s Favorite Customer sounds as lush as anything he’s done — a rich tapestry of AM-radio jangle and strum (Grade: A-).”  Stereogum  raved, saying, “Given the nature of the album, it feels almost crass to point out that Tillman pulled it off again. But he did, in making another stunning Father John Misty album.”  USA Today  gave the album a perfect score (4/4) and offered this, “Four albums in, he’s never been better than on  God’s Favorite Customer. ”   God’s Favorite Customer  also marks Father John Misty’s third top 20 entry on the  Billboard  Top 200 albums chart (#18).

That potential that is there for everyone, the different lives that are open to us.

While its predecessors had a tendency for introspection,  Sculptor  is wide open.”  And  NPR Music ’s Bob Boilen raves, “I can’t stop listening…I’ve waited for years for this record (see  All Songs Considered mix, May 29th ).” Sculptor  will be available on CD/LP/DL through Sub Pop and Misteltone.

Rather than obsessively write and rehearse at home in Duluth, Minnesota, they would often head southeast to Eau Claire, arriving with sketches and ideas that they would work on for days with Burton.

Disarray [Photo Credit: Shelly Mosman] More on Low’s  Double Negative  by Grayson Currin: In 2018, the band Low will turn twenty-five. Since 1993, Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker—the married couple whose heaven-and-earth harmonies have always held the band’s center—have pioneered a subgenre, shrugged off its strictures, recorded a Christmas classic, become a magnetic onstage force, and emerged as one of music’s most steadfast and vital vehicles for pulling light from our darkest emotional recesses. But Low will not commemorate its first quarter-century with mawkish nostalgia or safe runs through songbook favorites. Instead, in faithfully defiant fashion, Low will release its most brazen, abrasive (and, paradoxically, most empowering) album ever:  Double Negative , an unflinching eleven-song quest through snarling static and shattering beats that somehow culminates in the brightest pop song of Low’s career.   To make  Double Negative , Low reenlisted B.J. Burton, the quietly energetic and adventurous producer who has made records with James Blake, Sylvan Esso, and The Tallest Man on Earth in recent years while working as one of the go-to figures at Bon Iver’s home studio, April Base. Burton recorded Low’s last album, 2015’s  Ones and Sixes , at April Base, adding might to many of its beats and squelch and frisson beneath many of its melodies.   This time, though, Sparhawk, Parker, and bassist Steve Garrington knew they wanted to go further with Burton and his palette of sounds, to see what someone who is, as Sparhawk puts it, “a hip-hop guy” could truly do to their music. Rather than obsessively write and rehearse at home in Duluth, Minnesota, they would often head southeast to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, arriving with sketches and ideas that they would work on for days with Burton. Band and producer became collaborative cowriters, building the pieces up and breaking them down and building them again until their purpose and force felt clear. As the world outside seemed to slide deeper into instability, Low repeated this process for the better part of two years, pondering the results during tours and breaks at home. They considered not only how the fragments fit together but also how, in the United States of 2018, they functioned as statements and salves. Double Negative  is, indeed, a record perfectly and painfully suited for our time. Loud and contentious and commanding, Low fights  for  the world by fighting  against  it. It begins in pure bedlam, with a beat built from a loop of ruptured noise waging war against the paired voices of Sparhawk and Parker the moment they begin to sing during the massive “Quorum.” For forty minutes, they indulge the battle, trying to be heard amid the noisy grain, sometimes winning and sometimes being tossed toward oblivion.   During the immersive “Dancing and Blood,” Parker slowly comes into focus, as if singing from the wind-ripped mouth of a cave. Parker appears to beat back disaster for “Fly,” her soulful vocals curving into and above Garrington’s bold bassline as Sparhawk’s own signal cuts in and out. Elsewhere, though, songs like “Always Trying to Work It Out” and “Tempest” threaten to swallow the pair whole, their overwhelming quakes of dissonance aiming to silence them once and for all. Sometimes, Sparhawk and Parker are stuck in the Sisyphean middle, capable of neither failing nor forging ahead. During the brilliantly conceived “Poor Sucker,” written in large part by Garrington, their voices suggest skiffs stuck on some turbulent sea, falling beneath and rising above the cacophony with seasick irregularity. In this frustrated song of self-defeat, Low lists all the ways they could have made their lives matter. It is a eulogy of could-have-beens for a time that won’t really let you be.   As “Rome (Always in the Dark),” a march that forces its way through the din with damn-the-torpedoes tenacity, fades toward a rare silence, a pulse sculpted from a shard of noise emerges, flashing from a distance like the safety of a life raft. It rises into a steady thump, with Sparhawk and Parker floating above it in crystalline unison: “Before it falls into total disarray/You’ll have to learn to live a different way,” they sing, their melody forming a tightrope of despair and delight. In some ways, it’s a warning of the bad times to come. But it’s also a promise that we’re more powerful and adaptable than madness itself, that we have the ability to persevere. During the song’s back half, Sparhawk and Parker don’t say anything. They instead lock into august harmony and glide between notes, Parker’s purely ascendant tone pulling Sparhawk’s falsetto skyward. It is an exquisite and triumphant moment, an exhalation after all the damage and din.   In spite of the mounting noise, Sparhawk and Parker still sing. Or maybe they sing because of the noise. For Low, has there ever really been a difference?"},

Omori has shared a brand new video for song, “Happiness Reigns” [ as seen above here ], which was directed by Sarah Strunin and is a charming slice of power pop with lyrics that combine fatalistic imagery (“flowers of uranium/ and the kids just play along”) and a wide-eyed apologia to a woman, is perhaps the closest Cullen gets to the classic love-song ideal on   The Diet .     “Reigns” was not only inspired by Omori’s current girlfriend—she was intricately involved in his vision for bringing this love song a la Beatles or Rolling Stones “into the 21st century.” “Seldom are songs actually about the women in my life, but when I choose to write them I try to act in conspiracy with my ‘muse,’” he says. “On ‘Happiness Reigns,’ I was consciously trying to prevent the song from  lyrically falling into this one-way ode to an idolized muse. Of course some of my favorite artists like T-Rex or John Cale have albums chock full of them but my intention was never to be a rock classicist or to make something that was an extension of my influences. So I had her write it with me. If I was going to write this about someone, even in vague terms, I thought it would be interesting to intertwine their perception of themselves and of our relationship.” Cullen Omori Tour Dates +  Ticket Links Prior to the release of   The Diet,   Omori will embark on a seven date tour opening for the Japanese alternative rock band The Pillows.

{"title": "Deaf Wish Share Official Video for “FFS” The Propulsive And Excellent Lead Single From ‘Lithium Zion’, Their Forthcoming Album", "date": "TUE, JUN 5, 2018 at 1200 PM", "preview": "‘Lithium Zion’  will be available worldwide from Sub Pop on Friday, July 27th,  with the exception of the UK on Friday, August 3rd Melbourne’s  Deaf Wish  have returned with an official video for “FFS”, the propulsive and excellent lead single from  Lithium Zion , their forthcoming album. “FFS” was directed by band members Jensen Tjhung and Daniel Twomey, is shot in glorious black and white, and stars guitarist/vocalist Sarah Hardiman delivering an intense and engaging performance of the song. The music on  Lithium Zion  was collaboratively written by Deaf Wish, with each member taking turns on lyrical and vocal duties throughout the album. The album was recorded and mixed in Melbourne in April of 2017 with Nao Anzai, with additional mixing from Mikey Young of Total Control (who also mixed the group’s “St. Vincent’s” 7” single and  Pain  album, both released on Sub Pop). Lithium Zion  will be available on CD/LP/DL/CS worldwide on Friday, July 27th, except for the UK on Friday, August 3rd, through Sub Pop [pre-order here].   LP preorders of the album through  megamart.subpop.com  and  select independent retailers  will receive the limited Loser edition on hot pink vinyl (while supplies last).

Smoke [ Photo Credit:  Ela Stiles ] More on Deaf Wish’s  Lithium Zion  by Matt Korvette: There’s an inherent flaw in the perennially alternating “rock is back” and “rock is dead” arguments: they are based on the idea that rock music is a logic-based choice a person consciously chooses to make. Contrary to the critics who are looking to suss out cultural trends and movements (but have never actually lifted a greasy bass cab onto a stage in order to entertain a couple dozen people), the decision to play loud, distorted, unabashed guitar-rock isn’t a strategic move but a higher calling (or curse, depending on one’s point of view). Some might say the pursuit of rocking out via deafening amplifiers, crusty drums and a beer-battered PA is a spiritual one, an affliction that either strikes or doesn’t. Few groups today embody this sentiment like Melbourne’s aptly-named Deaf Wish.   They’re more likely to ask a fellow musician what they do for their “real” job (for one, guitarist Jensen Tjhung works as a builder) than talk shop about publicists, ticket counts and online promotions. They’re a grisly rock group and they’ve already signed to Sub Pop, which is to say they’ve already succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, so anything that comes after (performing in strange new cities, meeting like-minded souls, maybe even selling a t-shirt or two) is a bonus. And if they come to your town, you would be wise to clear your calendar: “I’ve started pouring a can of beer on my head every show. If that ain’t worth five bucks then I’m quitting show biz for good,” promises Tjhung.   Lithium Zion  is their fifth full-length album (and second for Sub Pop following 2015’s  Pain ), and while it’s a rare case that a group’s fifth album is their best, particularly any band operating under a “loud fast rules” ethos, Deaf Wish make a strong case as the exception. Their previous albums were all recorded in makeshift studios (Is that a basement with some quilts stapled to the ceiling? Now it’s a “studio”!), which of course is a wise aesthetic choice for capturing the hazardous riffing, chemically-stained vocals and fiery rhythms conjured by a group such as this, but this step toward a slightly more professional sound only enhances their power - think of the difference between a tangled pile of firecrackers and a red stick of TNT lodged in a hornets nest. The record opens with “Easy”, a languid rocker in the rich Australian tradition of groups like X and The Scientists. From there it’s onto “FFS”, a moody downhill rocker sung by guitarist Sarah Hardiman (“I feel like a fool / out playing pool / hitting on you”) that confirms Deaf Wish’s relation to fellow Sub Pop employees like feedtime and Hot Snakes. “The Rat Is Back” is tense and epic; “Hitachi Jackhammer” pays a brief and noisy tribute to Hitachi’s second most notable device (you’d be forgiven for assuming this song is about vibrators).  Lithium Zion  is a veritable buffet of garage-punk energy, post-punk pathos, sardonic wit and the fearlessness that comes with Aussie rock, a natural consequence for anyone living on a continent teeming with grapefruit-sized spiders and man-eating mosquito swarms.   As has always been the case, the whole group shares vocal duties, even drummer Daniel Twomey (you know the band is slightly unhinged if they’re letting the drummer sing). Hardiman and Tjhung are as ragged and hairy as ever, chugging along as though krautrock was trying to speed past the late ‘70s but got caught in the sticky grasp of punk. Such is the way of Deaf Wish, a group destined to write songs that are simultaneously stupid and sublime, vulnerable and ferocious, and play them with the unbridled intensity they demand. Anyone serving a life sentence to rock will surely concur."},

Reveals Lineup Details for SPF30 and 30th Anniversary Weekend Events August 10th-11th, 2018", "date": "TUE, MAY 29, 2018 at 930 AM", "preview": "SPF30: Sub Pop’s 30th Anniversary Festival with Beach House, Clipping, Kyle Craft, Fastbacks, Jo Passed, Loma, LVL UP, METZ, Moaning, Mudhoney, Shabazz Palaces, Wolf Parade, plus Caspar Babypants, The Not-Its and The School of Rock West Seattle House Band along Alki Beach in West Seattle. We are delighted to announce lineup details for  SPF30 and Sub Pop’s 30th Anniversary weekend , happening Friday, August 10th and Saturday, August 11th, 2018 in beautiful Seattle, Washington. The festivities kick-off the evening of Friday, August 10th at 5pm, with The Afghan Whigs, Mass Gothic and Yuno playing a  free, all-ages  outdoor concert at the Mural Amphitheatre, presented by KEXP and Seattle Center. Later that same evening, we are presenting A Night of Comedy From the Cast of Bob’s Burgers at The Moore Theatre, featuring H. Jon Benjamin, Eugene Mirman, Kristen Schaal, Larry Murphy and John Roberts. This is a ticketed event with proceeds to benefit Seattle’s YouthCare. YouthCare works to end youth homelessness and to ensure that young people are valued for who they are and empowered to achieve their potential. Founded in 1974, YouthCare was one of the first programs to serve runaway and homeless youth on the West Coast. The goal was to help young people find safety today and build a future for tomorrow. Over the past four decades, YouthCare has defined best practices and developed programs that are a national standard for excellence. Using a youth-centered approach, they ensure that young people experiencing homelessness ages 12-24 have the hope, skills, and confidence to gain long-term stability. Tickets for A Night of Comedy From the Cast of Bob’s Burgers will be $30 (plus fees). A special presale begins Wednesday, May 30th at 10am PT (presale code LOSER30), with tickets on sale to the general public Friday, June 1st at 10am PT.  Tickets are available here . Doors are at 7pm, and the show is all-ages. Then on Saturday, August 11th from noon-10pm, the Southwest Seattle Historical Society welcomes Sub Pop for SPF30, our 30th anniversary festival at West Seattle’s Alki Beach. SPF30 is an entirely free event featuring Beach House, Clipping, Kyle Craft, Fastbacks, Jo Passed, Loma, LVL UP, METZ, Moaning, Mudhoney, Shabazz Palaces, Wolf Parade, and a family stage featuring Caspar Babypants, The Not-Its and The School of Rock West Seattle House Band. The festival will feature four stages along incredibly scenic Alki Ave. in the Alki Beach neighborhood of West Seattle. Seattle’s Alki Beach boasts some of the most awesome territorial (city/water/mountain) views the city has to offer, along with the occasional whale sighting, a somewhat diminutive replica of the Statue of Liberty, and some of the best local businesses to boot. We are stoked (and not a little surprised) that the city cleared the permits. SPF30 will also have…A record fair-type event! A host of local nonprofit organizations! Food trucks! Beer gardens! (The food and beer and wine and soda or whatever, you will have to pay for! These parts are not free!) Good times and opportunities to embarrass yourself and those who’d always hoped for better for you! Plus, bands! And closing out the weekend is a late show celebrating the unbelievably “coincidental” 15th anniversary of Pissed Jeans held at the Crocodile in Seattle. This show is 21 +, and doors are at 8pm. Tickets are $16 and available  here . It is our hope that SPF30 and Sub Pop’s 30th Anniversary Weekend will serve as a super fun and sincere “thank you” to our local and global music community for supporting Sub Pop and our artists for the past 30 years (and the next 30!). In addition to celebrating a dynamic, inspirational roster spanning three decades, we also wish to create a sense of uplifting togetherness where we not only listen to great music but we become better at listening to each other as well.

The original singer of this version of song, Selena Quintanilla, reminds us that, while it often feels like history repeats itself, our mystic chords of memories - even memories of thoughts - become part our protection.

The bi-lingual Chicana, queer and Latino outfit are also a punch to the larynx of tired, white-washed punk rock that’s turned so far towards its own privileged naval.” [ Cost of Living ] -  Under The Radar “Like a cross between X-Ray Spex and Rage Against The Machine as reinterpreted via US hardcore.” [ Cost of Living ] -  Uncut   “Nobody writes like Ruiz and Joey DeFrancesco, who espouse strength in the face of oppression.”[ Cost of Living,  4/5] -   MOJO     ” Cost of Living  is refined, an example of a band who can still make an album sound angry and alive under its surface sheen.” [ Cost of Living ] -  Stereogum   ” Cost of Living,  the band’s third full album, does more than just chronicle what it’s like to be a non-straight and/or non-white working class person in America. It’s a declaration of war against the status quo.” [ Cost of Living ] -  Uproxx   “It’s a pure punk attack, with driving guitars, bulldozing drums, Victoria Ruiz’s uninhibited shouts of anger for the oppressed, and of course the sax.” [ Cost of Living ] -  Brooklyn Vegan   “Downtown Boys are an antidote to 2017.” [ Cost of Living ] -   Under the Radar   “They craft a punk record that finds perfection between raw energy, handfuls of talent and something to say.” [ Cost of Living,   8.0/10] -   Northern Transmissions   ” The Cost of Living  feels so vital because it’s not just a document of the times, or a surface level scanning of issues. Unlike so much modern ‘political’ music that falls into a sardonic appreciation of the world, Downtown Boys are on the streets, marching, rioting, singing. They want to be in the thick of it, because that’s the only way things will change.” [ Cost of Living,  4/5] -   Spectrum Culture    Cost of Living  is a testament to our need for Downtown Boy’s spirit, and to the possibility of compassion in the quest for equality.” [ Cost of Living ] -  The Fader   ” Cost of Living  will likely be remembered as a document of its time. However, Downtown Boys have done an admirable job of placing the specifics of their messages within the context of history, and infusing the record with a rich new musicality.” [ Cost of Living ] -  SPIN “A shot of pure adrenaline, Downtown Boys are an antidote to the carefully posed, cynical window of modern life. No time for frills, they’re true to their core. Start the riot.” [ Cost of Living,  4/5] -    Upset"},

{"title": "Luluc Will Release Their Gorgeous Third Album ‘Sculptor’ on July 13th, Shares New Single “Heist”", "date": "THU, MAY 10, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "‘We spray our hair into submission, upright to attention. Marching to no orders, imagination has no borders. Well lucky that.’ On July 13th, Luluc will release  Sculptor , their gorgeous third album worldwide on Sub Pop, with the exception of New Zealand and Australia through Mistletone. The new longplayer featuring highlights “Heist” [ hear here ], “Spring,” and “Kids”, was produced and recorded by Luluc. The album also includes guest appearances from J. Mascis, Aaron Dessner of the National, Jim White of the Dirty Three, Dave Nelson and Matt Ecles.   Sculptor  will be available on CD/LP/DL through Sub Pop and Misteltone. Preoders from megamart.subpop.com will receive the limited Loser edition on magenta vinyl. There will also be a new T-shirt design available. Luluc Sculptor Tracklisting 1. Spring 2. Heist 3. Kids 4. Controversy 5. Cambridge 6. Me and Jasper 7. Genius 8. Moon Girl 9. Need’t Be 10. Sculptor More on Luluc’s ‘Sculptor’: “Me and Jasper,” from Luluc’s third album  Sculptor , is a confident challenge to small-town insularity, lilting yet vigilant, and championed by a defiant guitar solo from the band’s friend J Mascis. It’s a reflection on a common pitfall of adolescence; limitless possibility battling constant obstruction. “My own experiences as a teen were often fraught” says songwriter and vocalist Zoe Randell. “The small town I grew up in provided a great study in gossip, scandal, character assignation and the willingness of people to go along with it.” It’s a song about fighting for agency on an album that is in many ways about volition and potential; how people can navigate difficulties and opportunities to create different paths.   Sculptor  can be consumed loud; because while Luluc’s music is at times masterful in it’s minimalism, it is anything but quiet in impact. There’s a before you hear Luluc’s music, and an after—a turning point that affects people with rare force. Janet Weiss of Sleater-Kinney says “it’s music that once you hear it, you can’t live without it”. The National’s Matt Berninger said that for months,  Passerby was “the only album I wanted to listen to”. “What first hits is that voice,” writes Peter Blackstock ( No Depression ),“a peaceful serenity that reaches deep into the heart.” When  NPR ’s Bob Boilen named 2014’s  Passerby  his album of the year, he wrote: “I’ve listened to this record by Australia’s Luluc more than any other this year. These songs feel like they’ve always been.”   That gripping, imperative quality pulses through  Sculptor , perhaps to an even greater extent than on  Passerby  or  Dear Hamlyn  (2008). Randell writes with more experimentation and possibility. From the contemplative scene of “Cambridge”, to the churning disaster chronicled in the title track, the songs on  Sculptor  are there for the taking. “Broadly speaking, with these new songs I was interested in the difficulties that life can throw at us - what we can do with them, how they can shape us, and what say we have,” Randell explains. “That potential that is there for everyone, the different lives that are open to us. That’s what I love in Ise’s poem ‘Spring Days and Blossom’ - which form the lyrics to “Spring” - the brimming sense of spring and it’s cycle, the enormity of what’s possible and the beauty.”   Sonically, the band have broadened their tonal palette following on from the successful collaboration on  Passerby,  co-produced with The National’s Aaron Dessner. Multi-instrumentalist, singer and producer Steve Hassett mastered a wider spectrum of instruments to fully realize the album’s expansive and daring vision. Randell and Hassett do nearly all of the writing, recording, and producing themselves, but their vision is far from insular. In addition to Mascis, Sculptor features contributions from several friends including Dessner (shreds on “Kids” and programmed drums on “Heist”) and Jim White of Dirty Three (drums on “Genius”) as well as musicians Matt Eccles on drums and Dave Nelson on horns. Recording took place in Luluc’s new Brooklyn studio, which they built themselves. The new studio is volition and potential in action and even incorporates reclaimed cedar from Dessner’s iconic former Ditmas Park studio, where The National and Luluc had both lived and recorded. That everyone has control of their own story is at the core of Sculptor . For Hassett, it’s illuminated by the last line of the title track, which is the last line of the record itself: ”‘The most beautiful, serene sculpture my hands could make, could trace, could break’. All of the songs are playing with those ideas,” he says. “Life is something you get, and you can get sidetracked for years and even destroy it, or you can remember that you’ve got some control over your life.” But listeners of  Sculptor  may yield some of that control, even if for a short time, to the mastery of the music itself.

The dark, atmospheric track rides an undulating bass line along a building, arrhythmic pulse of a drum beat.   7  is already earning Beach House some of the best reviews of the band’s career.  Stereogum  says of the album, “There are great bands that reinvent themselves with each new album, others that hit a sweet spot and stick with what works, and then there’s Beach House. Over their decade-plus career, some might argue that the Baltimore-based band has largely adhered to a formula, but with  7  — their excellent seventh album— it’s clear that the duo has been playing the long game.”   Pitchfork  offers this, “The record is one of rebirth, and easily the Baltimore duo’s most apparent sonic departure since 2012’s  Bloom. ” And  The FADER  raves, “The result is a weird and thrilling record that not only stands as one of the year’s best, but suggests that when it comes to pushing the limits of what the “Beach House sound” can be, Scally and Legrand are just getting started.” Beach House has also scheduled a late night TV performance on  Jimmy Kimmel Live  Wednesday, May 16th.

It happened pretty quickly. There was wine, dancing, then a song.” [Photo credit: Shawn Brackbill] Mass Gothic Tour Dates +  Ticket Links Mass Gothic’s previously announced US tour dates are underway supporting Modest Mouse.

In his own words, “the song is meant to be an exchange of perceptions: a duet except sung by one person.

Job well done, Cullen.” [“Cinnamon”] -  The 405 “Sour Silk” is the combination of sounds you weren’t sure could be mixed, blended into a song that sounds both effortless and endlessly faceted.” [“Sour Silk”] -  Stereogum “His songs marry dark yet blissful pop with vocal melodies and hooks that are at once immediate yet demand to be heard again and again.” [“Sour Silk”] -  Northern Transmissions “Led by dreamy, glimmering guitars, it takes Smith Westerns’ knack for a poppy hook to the next level.” [“Cinnamon”] -  Consequence of Sound"},

Return of the Frog Queen  is now available for preorder  right over here .   The vinyl edition of the album will be available on a limited run of purple vinyl (while supplies last). About Jeremy Enigk’s  Return of the Frog Queen Three good reasons why it’s hard to remember a time when an album like Jeremy Enigk’s  Return of the Frog Queen  sounded shocking:   1) At the time of its release in 1996, there was no other album like it.   2) In the 22 years between then and now, its marriage of seemingly opposing sensibilities—English folk and American punk; orchestral chamber pop and progressive rock; surreal, pastoral, fanciful lyrics that burn to express personal, emotional, and spiritual quandary—has become the blueprint for so much great music that a young listener can be forgiven for thinking that things were always just like that.   This isn’t to claim some kind of Velvet Underground/Big Star status for the album, but it is to say that you can draw a straight line between  Frog Queen  and elements of Elliott Smith, Belle & Sebastian, Rufus Wainwright, Destroyer, the Decemberists, Fleet Foxes, Sufjan Stevens, Beirut, Grizzly Bear, Joanna Newsom, Bon Iver, and many, many other artists who have come to define the past two decades of indie music.   3) It’s getting harder to remember anything anymore. But  Return of the Frog Queen  is worth remembering. Or discovering. And most definitely celebrating. Though you rarely see it turn up on lists of 50 Best Things of Whatever Year We Wish We Still Lived in Because the Present Is Such a Consummate Drag, the album was an indisputable innovation in the world of ‘90s indie rock, rewriting a litany of unwritten rules about sound, subject matter, and solo identity for lead singers of successful bands (read more at  Sub Pop )."},

And! Equally delightful, though more challenging to flip on eBay, a bunch of our artists are performing ( King Tuff  and  Yuno ), or doing DJ sets (Steve Turner of  Mudhoney , John Reis & Gar Wood of  Hot Snakes , and  Colleen Green ) in actual record stores! And all of this will be available or happen on Saturday, April 21st at participating retailers. Please find info on Thomas Andrew Doyle and a schedule of performances and DJ sets below. Thomas Andrew Doyle’s / Incineration Ceremony LP: Incineration Ceremony  is the new work by  Thomas Andrew Doyle  ( TAD , Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, Hog Molly) and is a return to roots of sorts. After spending his formative years in music playing in jazz clubs while attending school studying classical and jazz music at Boise State University, Doyle comes forth with a symphonic take on what is going on in his head. Spawned from the dark and dreary recesses of Doyle’s psyche comes an immense sound of textures, rhythms and material suitable for film and stand-alone listening, disquieting all who are within earshot. People who are familiar with his music should expect the unexpected. Doyle’s entry into the world of symphonic composition is no novice beginner’s attempt.  Incineration Ceremony  is a musical journeyman’s expression that is genuine, heartfelt, honest, uncompromising, and authoritative. Incineration Ceremony  is limited to 1,500 copies worldwide, and comes housed in a single-LP jacket with custom dust sleeve and grey/black vinyl. Incineration Ceremony  Tracklist: 1. Silent Incineration 2. Bio-Illogical Functions 3. Meditations in Null 4. Desire 5. Nurtured in Grief 6. The Only Thing You Truly Own Is Nothing  7. Prognati ignis ignis 8. Lost in Abyssmal Waters* 9.

His vocals – fitting beautifully into the current psychedelic renaissance spearheaded by the likes of Tame Impala and Washed Out – pour out an infectious melody that’s simultaneously great fun and inflected with melancholy.” -  Indie Shuffle   “Bouncy and bright…” -  Gorilla Vs. Bear.   “Charming us all with its buoyant pop flair and instrumentals that sound as if they were seemingly dipped in sunshine, “No Going Back” signals Yuno’s return in a way that’s almost impossible to shake. “No Going Back” is as promising as it is optimistic.” -  The Grey Estates   “Drifting digital pop casting a bittersweet spell.” –  CLASH"},

On May 25th, 2018, Sub Pop will release  Return of the Frog Queen , the newly remastered debut solo album from  Jeremy Enigk .  Return of the Frog Queen  has been out of print since its original 1996 pressing. This reissue includes the original album, remastered in 2018,  plus  digital bonus tracks from Enigk’s 1996 live session on Seattle radio station  The End .   Jeremy Enigk performed with legendary indie rock band Sunny Day Real Estate from 1993 to 2000. In 1996, following Sunny Day Real Estate’s first breakup (which lasted from 1995 to 1997), Enigk released  Return of the Frog Queen .   Return of the Frog Queen  represents a major shift from the sound of Sunny Day Real Estate. The album features a 21-piece orchestra backing Enigk as he performs striking, dramatic, chamber-pop compositions that demonstrate the full breadth of Enigk’s talents as a singer, musician, and songwriter. The album was produced by Greg Williamson, who also produced Sunny Day Real Estate’s 1998 comeback album,  How it Feels to Be Something On .  Return of the Frog Queen  is now available for preorder from  Sub Pop .  The vinyl edition of the album will be available on a limited run of purple vinyl (while supplies last).

[ Photo Courtesy of the Artist ] About Jeremy Enigk’s  Return of the Frog Queen Three good reasons why it’s hard to remember a time when an album like Jeremy Enigk’s  Return of the Frog Queen  sounded shocking: 1) At the time of its release in 1996, there was no other album like it.   2) In the 22 years between then and now, its marriage of seemingly opposing sensibilities—English folk and American punk; orchestral chamber pop and progressive rock; surreal, pastoral, fanciful lyrics that burn to express personal, emotional, and spiritual quandary—has become the blueprint for so much great music that a young listener can be forgiven for thinking that things were always just like that.   This isn’t to claim some kind of Velvet Underground/Big Star status for the album, but it is to say that you can draw a straight line between  Frog Queen  and elements of Elliott Smith, Belle & Sebastian, Rufus Wainwright, Destroyer, the Decemberists, Fleet Foxes, Sufjan Stevens, Beirut, Grizzly Bear, Joanna Newsom, Bon Iver, and many, many other artists who have come to define the past two decades of indie music.   3) It’s getting harder to remember anything anymore.   But  Return of the Frog Queen  is worth remembering. Or discovering. And most definitely celebrating. Though you rarely see it turn up on lists of 50 Best Things of Whatever Year We Wish We Still Lived in Because the Present Is Such a Consummate Drag, the album was an indisputable innovation in the world of ‘90s indie rock, rewriting a litany of unwritten rules about sound, subject matter, and solo identity for lead singers of successful bands.   THE BACKGROUND   As you probably know, Enigk was the singer/guitarist of Sunny Day Real Estate, the Seattle quartet widely credited as the Big Bang of the post-hardcore, indie rock variant of emo that would spend the next decade morphing into a massively commercial enterprise.   You can’t blame Sunny Day Real Estate for that, though. They were just a young, powerhouse band who happened to be several years ahead of their time.   SDRE’s debut album,  Diary , and its first single, “Seven,” was a seismic event, not least in the lives of the band members. It was released in May of 1994, one month and two days after Kurt Cobain’s suicide was discovered.  Diary became Sub Pop’s biggest-selling album since  Bleach —a distinction that lasted until the next decade.   The story of the band’s splintering during the making of their follow-up album ( LP2 )—and triumphant reunion a few years later—has been well-told elsewhere. But for our purposes, it’s worth bearing in mind that the break-up drama formed the background from which  Return of the Frog Queen  emerged.      In the space of about two years, Jeremy Enigk had joined a band with some friends, toured the world, sold way more records than anyone had anticipated, been heralded with hyperbolic—not to say unwarranted—praise, become a significant voice to a lot of young listeners, experienced a religious epiphany that he spoke of publicly, and watched the band buckle and fall apart, much to the dismay of a public that was only just starting to figure out how to broadcast its anxious speculations and judgments on the internet.   By the time the band broke up, he had been loved, respected, celebrated, criticized, vilified, and reproached. He was 21 years old.     One might expect a person might respond to all this sturm und drang by making noisy, chaotic, electric guitar-driven music of the kind his now-defunct band made its name with. One might expect someone whose character and even sanity had been widely debated in public might want to write a definitive statement about his identity, his ideology, his id.   But Jeremy Enigk didn’t do either of those things. He made  Return of the Frog Queen  instead.     ENTER THE FROG QUEEN   The songs that formed the basis of Enigk’s first solo album were about as far from the sound of Sunny Day Real Estate as you could imagine—unless all you’d heard of them was “Pheurton Skeurto,” the little piano songlet that sounds (delightfully) out of place on  Diary .   Spare acoustic guitar figures and solemn, almost plainsong melodies are the foundational elements, which Enigk and his two key collaborators, producer Greg Williamson and arranger/conductor Mark Nichols, build up into astonishingly dynamic worlds of sound. But for all the swoops and bends, the unconventional entrances and exits, the arrangements remain organic, and perfectly united behind the singular human voice at the center of it all.   From the very first strum on “Abegail Anne,” the music is stately, mysterious, vaguely mystical, and not even remotely interested in the ironic detachment still popular in those days.   If anything, the arrangements, and the stupefyingly strong vocals, are flagrantly theatrical. Enigk sang hard over loud instruments in SDRE, but nothing prepared you for the versatility of his voice on  Frog Queen . From a raspy whisper to conversational chest voice to clearly differentiated levels of high end—choked scream, melodic scream, head voice, falsetto, whatever you want. (And just a wisp of an unconscious British accent.)   But even at the peak of crescendo, as on the staggering climax of “Shade and the Black Hat,” on which Enigk wails “WON’T YOU STAY TONIGHT?” at the top of his range while the orchestra whips up a maelstrom—this music feels unfailingly intimate, while somehow remaining intensely private.   This is the central enigma (enigkma?) of the album: How can a song be both intimate and private? How can music that feels like fearless personal revelation grow more opaque the more closely you examine at it? Consider the author, and what his life was like at the time these songs were written and recorded. It’s easy to imagine a 21-year-old rock star manqué feeling overwhelmed, overexposed, overanalyzed, hungry for a kind of solace in which sound precedes meaning.   And yet, meaning is all over the record if you’re looking.   In among the pleasing, suggestively abstract imagery—“dallow water,” and “this dubious day,” and “window morning dream paradise”—Enigk plants lines that don’t require much interpretation at all if you’ve ever been anywhere near a break-up of a band or any other relationship, ever worried about what strangers might be saying about you, ever felt unseen, ever re-ran edited versions of old arguments in your mind, ever believed in something so fiercely that you were willing to lose friendships over it.   “Wait for, wait for me…”   “I’ve heard rumors…”   “No one knows my name…”   “What I’ve seen tears me inside…”   “Then the writing on the wall said he is only the way You said it was bad timing at least we had timing at all.”   These lines are crucial, but they’re also non-sequiturs, there for you to discover if you’re looking, but the songs still work beautifully if you never do.     But beyond the literal, there’s a spirit of fabulism in the lyrics—hardly a surprise on a record named after amphibian royalty. Who is this “Abegail Anne”? Where is this sleepy, enchanted “Lewis Hollow”? What does “hi, hey” mean? And how does he proceed so artfully from idle, drowsy contemplation of a lizard in a castle, observing the tremors of its “dreary heart,” to the roaring, soaring cascade of frustration bursting forth at song’s end? Who is being addressed, and by whom?   Trying to tease out the puzzle of these artfully esoteric lyrics has proven to be one of the album’s most durable pleasures (or possibly frustrations, if you prefer things spelled out). As time passes, the words might seem meaningless or profound depending on who  you  are, not who Enigk was.   It makes for an odd spin on the idea of self-revelation. The album unquestionably opens a window onto an unorthodox artist, pursuing an unorthodox process, to arrive at a most unorthodox production. But as with any great artwork, the real subject is the person looking at it.   ONWARD AND INWARD   Even after two decades, it’s difficult to find a name for the atmosphere conjured by the album. There are traces of Incredible String Band pastoralia, but also a strain of Pink Floydish unease. Bowie between  Man Who Sold the World and  Hunky Dory . It’s not dark exactly, but only because your eyes have adjusted to candlelight. It feels mystical, even metaphysical.   Emphasis on “physical.”   Jack Rabid of  The Big Takeover  nailed it in two sentences from his review:   “He pounds a piano and howls like his wife just left him for his best friend, as the violins, violas, and cellos scrape at their strings as if to break them, and the flutes, piccolos, trumpets, trombones, French horns, and clarinets blow like they were hired by a wolf to blast a few recalcitrant pigs’ houses down. The waves of classical countermelodies are extraordinary, adding on to each other to create an  1812 Overture  anvil clarion call, a roar so dense, so overpowering, it’s like gasoline exploding, even more so as they back Enigk’s fevered wail as if he were long past desperation.”   Return of the Frog Queen  was the very last thing anyone would have expected to come out of the singer of Sunny Day Real Estate, or really, the Pacific Northwest at that time—which was not long past a different kind of desperation.   Without knowing or intending it, Enigk and his collaborators made a record that pointed the way out of Seattle’s mid-‘90s post-boom-years malaise, which had no shortage of talent and desire, but lingering ambivalence about ambition, and no clear sense of cultural direction.   And then all of a sudden, here came an utterly singular demonstration that when all else fails, the most reliable direction is usually inward.   It’s unlikely that a generation of hopeful teenage garage bands formed as a response to eager suburban teens getting an earful of  Return of the Frog Queen . Maybe it’s just a coincidence then, that in the years following the record’s release (and the breathtaking live shows Enigk played with a stripped-down version of the 21-piece orchestra that plays on the record), indie music from the Pacific NW outwards, got more expansive, more idiosyncratic, a little riskier, and a lot weirder.   But it was for sure never the same."},

NOW WATCH VIDEO FOR SINGLE “TALKING STRAIGHT”", "date": "TUE, APR 10, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "Melbourne’s  Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever  are thrilled to announce that their highly-anticipated debut album,  Hope Downs , will be released on June 15 via Sub Pop. To coincide with this news, they’ve shared the above featured video (and single), “Talking Straight.”    Fittingly recorded in a house in the middle of the Northern NSW bush, “Talking Straight” hits hard with its driving rhythm and melodic, interweaving guitars, while reflecting on the loneliness of being a small person in the big universe. In singer/songwriter/guitarist Joe White’s own words:   “The concept came about when I heard someone talking about the possibility of us, humans, being alone in the universe, and how sad that would be. The idea in this song is that we might be lonely, but we could be lonely together.”   “Talking Straight” marks the second release of new music from the band for 2018. Previous single “Mainland” saw the band receive accolades from the likes of Pitchfork, Stereogum, and Paste, to name a few. The two songs collectively show how, after a pair of buzz-building EPs,  Hope Downs  is truly that album that was promised. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to. It’s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you’re going to get from a rock band right now. Having recently wrapped Australia’s Laneway Festival, where the band were a highlight act, Rolling Blackouts C.F. will gear up for a huge few months as they head over to North America and Europe to play a run of headline shows and festivals including Coachella, Shaky Knees, The Great Escape and Primavera Sound.

{"title": "ANNOUNCING THE 2018 SUB POP LOSER SCHOLARSHIP WINNERS!", "date": "FRI, APR 6, 2018 at 855 AM", "preview": "[ Photo: Ruby McShane ] After reading through hundreds upon hundreds of well thought-out and highly inspirational applications, we here at the Terribly Official Sub Pop Records Scholarship Committee have chosen three extraordinarily qualified student winners for our 2018 Sub Pop Loser Scholarship. Our $7,000 winner this year is  Ruby McShane  of Lincoln High School in Portland Oregon. Ruby blew us away with her sensational photography, drawings, mixed media card designs, and incredibly caring attitude. Her volunteer work helping refugees feel more acclimated in her community was a true inspiration. In her application essay Ruby showed us an incredible love for music and visual arts as well as an outgoing compassion that set her apart from all of the other applicants. Working to stop the bullying of non-conformists is a cause we here at Sub Pop can definitely get behind and Ruby is all about it. Reed College will be lucky to have Ruby in attendance next year as she brings her great talent, activism and creativity to their campus.  Yasmin Ettobi  of Central Kitsap High in Silverdale, Washington walks away with $5,000 this year for her submission to the Sub Pop Loser Scholarship. As a young writer Yasmin found that writing for the school paper wasn’t quite enough, and turned her efforts to covering music. Yasmin soon began writing album reviews, live show reports and editorial articles for a grip of online publications, all at the age of 17. Passion shines through her writing about music and it is clear to us that Yasmin is going to grow into an incredible journalist, as her music writing skills are already top flight. As a KEXP volunteer, a member of the MoPop youth advisory board, and a  photographer at live shows, Yasmin has already heavily contributed to her local music community and we’re confident she’ll be making many more contributions to the scene as the years go by. Mia Barnes  of Franklin High School in Portland will be receiving $3,000 as a 2018 Sub Pop Loser Scholarship winner. Mia is the most talented illustrator we have seen apply for the Loser Scholarship in many years. Her drawings and paintings are out of this world: alien-like, monstrous, gross, and beautiful. We’d be fools not to mention Mia’s incredible application, which came in the form of a four-page, hand-illustrated comic letting us know exactly why she deserves to be a Loser winner. Mia’s talent for illustration, layout and design is going to grow into something even more special in the years to come. Our scholarship committee could not get enough of Mia’s comic and as soon as we saw her application, we knew she was definitely a Sub Pop Loser.  This year we had a record number of applicants for the Loser Scholarship, which made this the hardest selection process we’ve ever had. For those losers who didn’t win this year: thank you for applying, we loved your submissions too! You made this decision really tough on us and you’re an incredibly inspiring bunch of people. We’re certain that you will go on to blow us all away with your future accomplishments. Thanks for playing. \n   \n     \n\n       \n         \n           Join our mailing list for  the  Mega Mart \n           \n         \n\n         \n           Your Email Address"},

[ Photo Credit: Julia Leiby ] Following the band’s acclaimed 2015 EP  Slop ,  Forth Wanderers  amplifies the heartfelt sentiments of the band’s earlier works into massive anthems. Ben Guterl and Duke Greene’s guitars have never sounded so sharp, Noah Schifrin and Zach Lorelli’s terse rhythm section is restless, and vocalist-lyricist Ava Trilling seems more self-assured than ever. “We have embraced our roles in the collaboration process,” says Guterl. “Everyone’s gotten better at their instruments and we trust each other more because we know how the machine works.” This spirit soars through  Forth Wanderers , resulting in exuberant, profound songs driven by tightly bound melodies and a loving attention to detail (read more  here )."},

The black and white video depicts singer Emily Cross sprawled out in bed, anxiously shifting as a sliver of reflected television dances in the background. The spark that led to Loma’s creation occurred in 2016 during a European tour in which Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski’s project, Cross Record, opened for Jonathan Meiburg’s band, Shearwater. After an especially memorable show in Belgium, Meiburg approached Cross and Duszynski about working together. Two years later, their collaborative project, Loma, has released a debut album, and the trio is embarking on a tour spanning 3 months and 12 countries.

The visuals…are unusual and outlandish, the costumed characters and eye-popping imagery inspired by the act of stepping into someone’s dream.

{"title": "Now Here’s Another New Song From King Tuff’s Forthcoming Album: “Thru The Cracks” Featuring Guest Vocals From Jenny Lewis", "date": "WED, MAR 21, 2018 at 655 AM", "preview": "Today,  King Tuff  has shared ” Thru The Cracks ,” the latest single from his forthcoming (and highly anticipated) new album,  The Other . “Thru the Cracks” is a powerful reflection on losing a friend to suicide and finding their spirit throughout the beautiful moments of life. The song features guest vocals by Jenny Lewis, backing vocals by Greta Morgan (Springtime Carnivore), and drums by Charles Moothart (Mikal Cronin, Ty Segall, Fuzz). A more soulful offering than the groove-based singles that have come before it, “Thru the Cracks” is another shining example of the multi-faceted artistic direction that Kyle Thomas has taken as King Tuff.  [Photo Credit: Olivia Bee] Of the song, Thomas says: “About two years ago I lost a good friend to suicide. He loved the Beatles, Nirvana, Burroughs, bumming smokes, stealing his parents records and selling em to me… he was a complex character, a sweetheart with poor social skills, a musical genius with no outlet. He was pretty damn misunderstood in this world and struggled for a long, long time. I had this song laying around for 7 years or so, but sadly it wasn’t until he was gone that it came into focus and I realized what it was all about. It’s one of my favorites I’ve ever written, and one of the truest. And it all comes back again to this thing, the  Other . Maybe death is just a passageway to something else. Maybe in death we finally, once and for all, join the  Other . I dunno, but I think Jeremiah is probably hanging out on the metaphysical stoop right now with none other than the  Other  itself. Wherever you are bud, I’m singing to you” The Other  is available for  pre-order  now and is due out April 13th. Thomas self-produced  The Other  and brought in Shawn Everett (War On Drugs, Alabama Shakes) to assist with the mixing process.No less hooky than previous records, the new songs ditch the goofy rock-and-roll bacchanalia narratives of earlier records in favor of expansive arrangements, a diversity of instrumentation, and lyrics that straddle the fence between painful ruminations and reconnecting with that part of yourself that feels childlike and creative and not corroded by cynicism. The record features contributions from Ty Segall (drums), Jenny Lewis (vocals), Greta Morgan (vocals), and Mikal Cronin (saxophone). Thomas views the entire experience of the record as a kind of psychic reset. “I let the songs lead me where they wanted to go, instead of trying to push them into a certain zone. King Tuff was always just supposed to be me. When I started doing this as a teenager, it was whatever I wanted it to be. King Tuff was never supposed to be just one thing. It was supposed to be everything.” King Tuff Tour Dates + Ticket Links King Tuff has also announced a North American tour beginning May 3rd in San Diego.

And the band’s recently reissued catalog - Automatic Midnight, Suicide Invoice and Audit in Progress - is also available now on  Sub Pop . What’s the word on Hot Snakes’ Jericho Sirens? Well, since you asked: “On its three previous records, the group was willing to toy with sustain and release, tension and construction — look at songs like “Suicide Invoice” or “Lovebirds.” Those days are gone. Jericho Sirens is a punched-in wall. Between the doom of the opening bars to “I Need a Doctor” and the homage the record closes on (“Death of a Sportsman” crash-ends with a direct lift from Suicide’s epochal, nihilistic “Ghost Rider” and that song’s four-note spine) lives the sound of not being able to itch your pox. Ever.” [Jericho Sirens, First Listen] -  NPR Music “This is yet another example of Hot Snakes at the top of their game, except this time they gave 14 years in exile for other, lesser bands to catch up with them only to reclaim the throne with ease.” [Jericho Sirens, 9/10] -  Drowned in Sound “The very definition of kickass” [Jericho Sirens, 4/5] -  The Guardian “Jericho Sirens sounds more unstable and aggressive…The palpable anxiety of “I Need A Doctor” opens the album, segueing into the dissonant dread of “Candid Cameras” and the ferocious 78 seconds of “Why Don’t It Sink In?” “Death Camp Fantasy” is a vintage Hot Snakes pounder, and Froberg howls like Brian Johnson in “Psychoactive.” It all works. Whenever Hot Snakes decide to get together, they will always be welcome.” [Jericho Sirens, A-] -  AV Club “This is a winner from start to finish.” [Jericho Sirens, 4/5] -  Q “It’s got all the traits that make Hot Snakes the unique band they always were: the fury of hardcore, the dissonant riffs of noise rock, the fuzz-drenched party of garage rock. They’ve got no fat on this thing — it’s over and done with in 30 minutes and reply value is very high — and the songs aren’t just rippers but catchy too.” [Jericho Sirens, “5 Notable Releases This Week”] -  Brooklyn Vegan “Hot Snakes are as dry, dented and slightly demented as ever.” [Jericho Sirens, 8/10, “Album of the Week”] -  The Line of Best Fit  “At its core, Jericho Sirens bears all of the elements that made up Hot Snakes’ excellent first trio of albums: a sharp clash of guitars, pummeling punk-rock rhythms, and Froberg’s frantic, strained bark. Yet there’s even more tension and agitation than usual, even for a band whose discography is founded on that very agitation.” [Jericho Sirens, Album of the Day] -  Bandcamp “Their lengthy hiatus has clearly not dulled Hot Snakes’ razor-sharp edge, one bit, making Jericho Sirens a very welcome return.” [Jericho Sirens, 4/5] -  Kerrang! “It’s a suplex to your ears, a fire in your spirit, a get-up-and-go, absolutely run-wild affair. It’s what Hot Snakes has always been, and always will be: masters of primal, visceral aesthetics.” [Jericho Sirens, Album of the Week] -  Treble “Comebacks are complicated, for bands and fans too, but this is one for the ages. Hot Snakes have returned, reminding those of us who’ve paid attention that they are definitively one of the greatest rock bands we’ve ever known.” [9/10] -  Exclaim! “Jericho Sirens is an incredible turn, and proof to the other half-hearted post-hardcore comebacks of the last years (looking at you At the Drive-In, Refused and more) that it is possible to still be high-quality and relevant. In fact, in places Hot Snakes’ fourth album is so good, it even puts newer bands who have come up in the meantime to shame.” [Jericho Sirens, 5/5] -  The Skinny “A band that holds a timeless appeal to anyone who grew up on hardcore and garage rock, a promise of good times fused to a pummeling sense of aggression and resolve.” -  Chicago Tribune “This band will not change your life, probably. But it will make your life both more terrifying and way more bearable. It’s an honor, genuinely, to be pummelled and trampled by some of the best.” [Jericho Sirens] -  The Ringer “Jericho Sirens, the fourth Hot Snakes album, is a cathartic pileup of chunky guitar slashes and feverish yelps. It’s dense and physical and nasty and fun as hell. We’ve already posted the excellently-titled early tracks “Six Wave Hold-Down” and “Death Camp Fantasy,” and now the whole album is out there online, ready for your solo desk-chair moshing. (You do that too, right? It’s not just me?).” [Jericho Sirens]-  Stereogum   “Hot Snakes’ caustic, erudite commentary is more welcome than ever” [Jericho Sirens, 4/5] -  MOJO   “Hot Snakes throw one hell of a rock and roll party; let’s hope the invites to the next one don’t take another fourteen years to arrive” [Jericho Sirens, 4/5] -  DIY   “It’s exactly what you want out of a Hot Snakes jam, with a riff that snarls and swaggers like a hot rod, its wild hair of a melody built into the stylish chrome.” [“Six Wave Hold-Down”] -  NPR Music   “And after teasing a new song, they’ve now shared the slashing, propulsive “Six Wave Hold-Down,” a song that’s absolutely worthy of their old albums.” [“Six Wave Hold-Down”] -  Stereogum   “Charges forward with reckless abandon…” [“Six Wave Hold-Down”] -  Consequence of Sound   “A ripper which has Hot Snakes sounding as inspired as ever…” [“Six Wave Hold-Down”] -  Brooklyn Vegan"},
{"title": "Yuno To Support Twin Shadow On Spring U.S. Tour Dates April 20th-May 2nd", "date": "FRI, MAR 16, 2018 at 655 AM", "preview": "Yuno  has just announced his first-ever U.S. live performances supporting Twin Shadow, beginning April 20th in San Francisco at Popscene and ending May 2nd in Brooklyn, NY at Music Hall of Williamsburg. Like so:    Apr. 20 - San Francisco, CA - Popscene Apr. 22 - Portland, OR - Mississippi Studios Apr. 23 - Seattle, WA - The Crocodile Cafe Apr. 27 - Washington, DC - U Street Music Hall May 02 - Brooklyn, NY - Music Hall of Williamsburg   News of this support tour comes on the heels of Yuno’s Sub Pop signing and the release of his breakout single ( and official video ) for “No Going Back.” Yuno’s bittersweet vocals glide over a buoyant bass line and, fittingly, one of the song’s central themes is passing a point of no return. Yuno also both stars in and directs the “No Going Back” visual. Listen to Yuno’s first single on Sub Pop, “No Going Back” - currently climbing the charts on  Spotify  +  Apple Music  +  YouTube . NPR Music  calls “No Going Back” “an early entry into the race for song of the summer.” And  Pitchfork  gave the song “Best New Track’ status, and had this to say: “‘No Going Back” insists what we’re all thinking for the new pop wunderkind: Only forward.”   Read more about Yuno right  over here .   What people are saying about Yuno’s “No Going Back”: “Yuno’s lithe voice floats amidst the cheerful soundscape, bouncing off the plucky piano keys… the brand of sunny pop displayed on ‘No Going Back’ should earn him his own cult fanbase.” -  Impose   “It’s light and breezy indie-pop, with warm and bouncy synth-lines softly coloured over with warm piano melodies and guitar solos. His vocals – fitting beautifully into the current psychedelic renaissance spearheaded by the likes of Tame Impala and Washed Out – pour out an infectious melody that’s simultaneously great fun and inflected with melancholy.” -  Indie Shuffle   “Bouncy and bright…” -  Gorilla Vs. Bear.   “Charming us all with its buoyant pop flair and instrumentals that sound as if they were seemingly dipped in sunshine, “No Going Back” signals Yuno’s return in a way that’s almost impossible to shake. “No Going Back” is as promising as it is optimistic.” -  The Grey Estates   “Drifting digital pop casting a bittersweet spell.” -  CLASH"},
{"title": "Sub Pop + KEXP - 30 Years of Swingin’ on the Flippity-Flop", "date": "MON, MAR 12, 2018 at 900 AM", "preview": "Our friends at KEXP came up with a pretty epic 30th birthday gift… and it starts today! KEXP will be honoring  every  Sub Pop catalog release, in chronological order, over the coming months. Read on for details… [Photo Credit: David Ryder/Getty Images, via Pitchfork] via  KEXP :  SEATTLE, March 8, 2018 –  Legendary independent record label Sub Pop will turn 30 years old this year, and Seattle-based public broadcaster and arts organization KEXP will pay tribute to the label with a four-month retrospective. With over 1,200 releases, the station is planning to honor every single catalog number in the history of the Seattle based label. The tribute will wrap up in time for Sub Pop’s 30th anniversary concert at Alki Beach in West Seattle this August. “Sub Pop and KEXP go back a long way,” said KEXP Chief Content Officer Kevin Cole. “Our histories are intimately connected - we certainly wouldn’t be who we are without the amazing music and incredible community that Sub Pop has helped to create here in Seattle. Sub Pop is family to KEXP.” Sub Pop co-founders Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman each had a show on KEXP’s predecessor, KCMU, prior to the formation of the label. Pavitt’s show -  Sub Pop USA  -  focused on celebrating artists and releases on independent regional labels, while Poneman was one of the first hosts of  Audioasis , the local music program that still airs weekly on KEXP. Mark Arm of Sub Pop bands  Mudhoney  and  Green River , and  Soundgarden ’s Kim Thayil had shows on KCMU, as did Charles Peterson, well-known for capturing iconic photographs of the nascent Seattle grunge scene on behalf of the label. “Bruce Pavitt and I both had air shifts at the former KCMU. KEXP is sort of KCMU unchained, except that the present KEXP air staff have been trained, get paid and drink fancier coffee,” said Jonathan Poneman.  “KCMU and Sub Pop Records both began as a pastime for music hobbyists who liked to stay indoors and play records. It’s been our good fortune to have successfully nurtured a reciprocal relationship with our hometown, Seattle: by providing great music to our community, people support it and listen.” According to an account on  HistoryLink ,  Poneman and Pavitt were first introduced to  Nirvana  as KCMU DJs, through a demo tape they received from producer Jack Endino. The tape was enough to get the band its first-ever radio airplay for demo versions of ‘Floyd the Barber’ and ‘Paper Cuts,’ songs which would show up over a year later on  Bleach . After Sub Pop released Nirvana’s first official single, ‘Love Buzz’, in 1988, Kurt Cobain personally gave a copy to KCMU, and then sat in his car with the radio tuned to the station. When the DJ didn’t put the record on immediately, Cobain found a pay phone and called the station to request it himself. “Bands were very aware of the role KCMU was playing in helping them out,” said Soundgarden’s Kim Thayil in an oral history of KCMU/KEXP published in  CityArts Magazine in 2015 . “KCMU was a networking hub for that seminal Seattle scene, Sub Pop and what came to be known as grunge, though I hate that word. It pivoted around KCMU.” To this day, a strong connection remains. In 2013, KEXP helped celebrate Sub Pop’s 25th Anniversary with a live broadcast of Sub Pop artists performing on top of the Space Needle. “We probably play more artists from Sub Pop than any other label,” said KEXP’s John Richards, host of The Morning Show on KEXP. “And that’s not necessarily on purpose, or because we feel like we need to play their music - it’s just that good, and their catalog is that deep. Every DJ on KEXP picks their own music, and with Sub Pop, there’s an amazing breadth and variety of killer releases to choose from.” “Over the past 30 years Sub Pop has been home to the era-defining rock of Nirvana, Soundgarden and Mudhoney and the label has also had the privilege of releasing music from artists like  Shabazz Palaces , whose art is endlessly expansive and whose creativity is unparalleled,” said Sub Pop CEO Megan Jasper. “We are so proud to work with so many musicians whose songs have changed our moods, our culture and us as individuals. And we can’t wait to learn what the next 30 years will bring!” The Sub Pop  Count-Up will begin on the first full weekday of KEXP’s 2018 Spring Fundraising Drive, on Monday March 12th. Throughout the following months, KEXP DJs will honor each Sub Pop catalog item in chronological order, including full albums, singles, EPs, compilations, early Sub Pop fan zines,  and even a wedding soundtrack.  KEXP.ORG  will also feature online-exclusive content, interviews and more throughout the  four -month tribute.

Despite the inherent heaviness of those themes,  Forth Wanderers  feels joyous, a rock record bursting with heart. The album’s opening track “Nevermine” is the perfect summation of feelings and themes, with singer Ava Trilling’s lyricism exuding a surge of confidence inspired by an ex-lover who is still captivated by her image. “I don’t think I know who you are anymore/ and I don’t think I knew who I was before” she jabs with relish” Noisey  premiered the track and offered this, “It’s a winding, restless, half-paced song in which Trilling jabs confidently at a former partner: “I am the one you think of when you’re with her.” It never quite settles down, flitting between its four sections, each of which is catchy enough to be a chorus on its own. [see  Noisey  premiere March 8th ].” Forth Wanderers Tour Dates +  Ticket Links Forth Wanderers have scheduled three Northeastern U.S. dates with Fat Possum recording act Hoops May 3rd-5th, 2018.   May 03 - Washington, DC -  Rock & Roll Hotel * May 04 - Philadelphia, PA - First Unitarian Church * May 05 - Brooklyn, NY - Market Hotel * *w/ Hoops Forth Wanderers , featuring the standouts “Nevermine,” “ Not for Me ” and “Ages Ago,” and was produced and recorded by Cameron Konner in Philadelphia over 5 days in the summer of 2017. The album will be available on CD/LP/CS/DL through Sub Pop  over here .  LP pre-orders through  megamart.subpop.com  and select independent retailers will receive the limited Loser edition on opaque orange vinyl.   Recorded over five days by friend and audio engineer Cameron Konner at his Philadelphia home studio,  Forth Wanderers  amplifies the heartfelt sentiments of the band’s earlier works into massive anthems. Ben Guterl and Duke Greene’s guitars have never sounded so sharp, Noah Schifrin and Zach Lorelli’s terse rhythm section is restless, and vocalist-lyricist Ava Trilling seems more self-assured than ever. “We have embraced our roles in the collaboration process,” says Guterl. “Everyone’s gotten better at their instruments and we trust each other more because we know how the machine works.” This spirit soars through  Forth Wanderers , resulting in exuberant, profound songs driven by tightly bound melodies and a loving attention to detail (read more at  Sub Pop )."},
{"title": "Beach House To Release ‘7’, The Group’s 7th Album, Worldwide On May 11th, 2018. Now Experience The Transcendent New Track, “Dive”", "date": "WED, MAR 7, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "Headlining worldwide tour dates: April 30th-October 20th, 2018 Cry those tears of joy, because  Beach House  will release  7 , the group’s 7th full-length record, on CD/LP/CS/DL May 11th, 2018. The new Beach House album will be available worldwide on Sub Pop, except in Europe and Australia/New Zealand, where it will be released by Bella Union and Mistletone. 7 Lemon Glow Dive 7   [ Photo Credit: Shawn Brackbill ] Beach House (Alex Scally and Victoria Legrand) released  B-sides and Rarities  in 2017, which served as a proverbial “cleaning out the closet” to pave way for a new creative process.  Their approach in the creation of  7  was rebirth and rejuvenation.  Scally and Legrand used to limit themselves to what they thought they could perform live, but this time that limitation was ignored.  Also, instead of one long studio session, Beach House recorded when inspired by batches of songs, which resulted in five mini-sessions over the course of eleven months.   Unlike the last four albums,  7  didn’t have a producer in the traditional sense. Spacemen 3’s Sonic Boom (Peter Kember) became a significant force on this record by shedding conventions and helping to keep the songs alive, fresh, and protected from the destructive elements of recording studio overproduction and over-perfection.  The band’s trusted live drummer from 2016 to the present, James Barone, played on the entire record, helping to keep rhythm at the center of a lot of these songs. 7  is available for preorder now from  Sub Pop ,  Bella Union  (Europe), and  Mistletone  (Australia / New Zealand).  Pre-orders of the LP through  megamart.subpop.com  and select independent retailers in North America will receive the limited Loser Edition on opaque yellow vinyl.

All of the beings in the animation are affected by how they perceive themselves through the internet, or through technological devices they have come in contact with. In this animated take on the song, the ‘parasitic demon’ is the worshiping and addiction of the augmented reality,” VanGaalen says of the new visual, which he animated meticulously over the last four months.

{"title": "LISTEN TO KING TUFF’S “RAINDROP BLUE” A NEW SINGLE FROM HIS FORTHCOMING RECORD, ‘THE OTHER’", "date": "WED, FEB 28, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "North American Tour On Sale Now Today,  King Tuff  has shared another new song off his forthcoming album,  The Other [ pre-order here ] , out April 13th via Sub Pop Records. “Raindrop Blue,” oozing with soulful bass lines and pulsating saxophone melodies, continues Kyle Thomas’s new artistic vision as King Tuff. You’re listening to the song here now via the Emmanuelle Pickett-directed visuals above. Pre-order for the album is  available now . Speaking about “Raindrop Blue,” Thomas lays out its relevance to the greater story of the album and its relationship to the previously-released song ” The Other ”: “…I took the hand of the Other…you fell onto my fingers like velvet to the touch… Is Raindrop Blue the lost forgotten lover? Is she the Other? Is she the Blue Subaru? Funny story about that Blue Subaru… I wrote “The Other” in October 2016. At the time it was a fictional story about losing myself and the quest to find the creative spirit again. I imagined myself driving around in a 1982 blue Subaru Brat, which has been my dream car ever since I was a little kid. I would see them driving around my hometown, Brattleboro, Vermont, and I thought the name Brat had something to do with the town itself. It always seemed like the unicorn of cars; you’d only catch a glimpse of one when you weren’t looking. So I was driving this car around in my song cuz you can do whatever you want inside a song. A year and a half later and the album was done. I sent it to my good friend Em so she could take a listen. She’s been in school studying dreams and alchemy, and we talked about the dark side of the moon, the flip side of the mirror, the unknowable Other and things in the lyrics which were oddly in line with her studies. She’s always had the most poetically surreal dreams as long as I’ve known her, full of symbols and strange beauty, like she’s tapped into some kinda psychic conduit. She was in Vermont but her dreams had been telling her to go to New Mexico. She needed transportation for when she got there, so she was hunting around on Craigslist to find some dusty old high-desert gem she could zoom around in. The first car that popped up: “1982 Blue Subaru Brat in Albuquerque.” The exact car from my song. She sent me the ad. I immediately booked a flight out there, bought the car, and drove her back to LA in a blaze of romantic glory. The lyrics in the song had somehow come true. It felt like whatever this mysterious “Other” was, it seemed like maybe it was on my side. Helping me along. As long as I had faith in it. So..is Raindrop Blue the Other? or the Subaru? Probably both and probably neither. But one thing is for certain: I love to dance.” Thomas self-produced the record and brought in Shawn Everett (War On Drugs, Alabama Shakes) to assist with the mixing process.No less hooky than previous records, the new songs ditch the goofy rock-and-roll bacchanalia narratives of earlier records in favor of expansive arrangements, a diversity of instrumentation, and lyrics that straddle the fence between painful ruminations and reconnecting with that part of yourself that feels childlike and creative and not corroded by cynicism. The record features contributions from Ty Segall (drums), Jenny Lewis (vocals), Greta Morgan (vocals), and Mikal Cronin (saxophone). Thomas views the entire experience of the record as a kind of psychic reset. “I let the songs lead me where they wanted to go, instead of trying to push them into a certain zone. King Tuff was always just supposed to be me. When I started doing this as a teenager, it was whatever I wanted it to be. King Tuff was never supposed to be just one thing. It was supposed to be everything.” King Tuff Tour Dates + Ticket Links On top of all this good news, King Tuff has also announced a North American tour beginning May 3rd in San Diego.

{"title": "We Signed Vancouver B.C.’s Jo Passed! Now See/Hear Video For “MDM” From The Band’s First Full-Length, ‘Their Prime’ (out May 25th)", "date": "TUE, FEB 27, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "Their Prime  will be available worldwide from Sub Pop Records with the exception of Canada through Royal Mountain Records Stoked to announce we signed Canadian rippers  Jo Passed , and on May 25th we’ll release  Their Prime , the band’s first full-length record, worldwide through Sub Pop Records, with the exception of Canada through Royal Mountain Records.  The album, which features the singles “ MDM,” “Glass” and “Millennial Trash Blues,” was recorded during the fall / winter of 2016/17 at Thor’s Palace & KW Studios, both in the band’s hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia.   The band have delivered an official video for  Their Prime  standout “MDM,” which was directed by Eleanor Petry.” Bandleader Jo Hirabayashi says of the video, “something something, on my phone too much, something something, marshall mcluhan, something something, stanley kubrick, something something, the medium is the message, something something, ouch my insides.”   Jo has been part of the DIY music scene since his late teens. Initially it was just him and his high school best friend Elliot Langford against the world. They were the “freaky music weirdos” and they began their own band projects. Jo was pretty sure that it would be two of them riding into the sunset – or maybe the gloom – together. Personal circumstances and the phenomenon of the late 20s return of Saturn (for those who believe in astrology) got in the way. Their band Sprïng called it a day. That’s where the life of Jo Passed began. The idea of a band dynamic is far more appealing to Jo than solo projects, and the current incarnation of Jo Passed feels like its most robust yet.     Jo, along with his friend and drummer Mac Lawrie, moved across the country from Vancouver to Montreal. The two would play shows in Montreal and eventually tour the far right corner of North America. Upon Jo’s return to the west coast, multi-instrumentalist Bella Bébé officially joined the band in January of 2016, expanding Jo Passed from trio to a full quartet. Multimedia artist Megan-Magdalena Bourne began working with Jo Passed on a video project for the song “Rage” (from the  Out  EP). This creative partnership would eventually lead to her taking on the role of bassist for the band.   When not geeking out over The Zombies, or Nirvana, or Johann Sebastian Bach… Bella, Mac, and Megan have worked with Jo to realize the live experience of  Their Prime , following two Jo Passed EPs titled  Up  and  Out . Jo Passed Tour Dates +  Ticket Links Jo Passed has scheduled a few spring club shows and festival dates before hitting the road later this year. Current highlights include shows with Hardly Art’s Dick Stusso (March 16th-24th) and an appearance at Treefort Music Festival in Boise (March 21st).  Mar. 16 - Bozeman, MT - Labor Temple* Mar. 18 - Denver, CO - Lost Lake Lounge* Mar. 19 - Salt Lake City, UT - Kilby Court* Mar. 21 - Boise, ID - Treefort Music Festival Mar. 22 - Seattle, WA - Barboza* Mar. 24 - Portland, OR - Crush House * Apr. 14 - Victoria, BC - Lucky Bar *w/ Dick Stusso Preorders for  Their Prime  are now available through  Sub Pop  and  Royal Mountain Records .  LP purchases in North America through  megamart.subpop.com  and select independent retailers will receive the limited Loser edition on clear vinyl (while supplies last).    Their Prime  is a record about identity and the loss of time that happens as a direct consequence of being in the city with nowhere to rent, no time outside of employment and no realistic expectations to live up to. It encompasses that fear of being beyond the glory years, the most creatively fruitful period of one’s life. Those years were lost to contemporary struggles for working relationships, home, identity and space. “It’s me owning my worst nightmare,” he admits. “A lot of the Jo Passed project has been about confronting fears. I was afraid to move away from Vancouver to Montreal on my own. Afraid to leave musical relationships I had. Afraid to bare the full responsibility of a project. I’ve been putting out records and not ones anyone’s necessarily heard. Being open about those fears is a good way of dealing with them. You end up at this point where you hit 30 and you’re like, ‘Oh what happened? Am I done? Did I not activate my main creative energy?’ It’s a ridiculous idea but 30 feels a little like 1000 in rock n roll terms.” You can hear the frustrations and the jitters in the crashing loud-and-quiet motifs throughout the album’s twelve tracks, which offer up a patchwork quilt of sound, similar to Faust’s  IV  or Fugazi’s  Red Medicine [read more at  Sub Pop ]."},

{"title": "We Signed Jacksonville’s Yuno! Now Watch His Official Video For Exuberant Single “No Going Back”", "date": "WED, FEB 21, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "Please join us in welcoming multi-talented artist  Yuno  to Sub Pop Records! We will release his music into the world throughout 2018, beginning with this official video for “No Going Back.” Trust us, you’re about to listen on repeat ->  YouTube  |  Spotify  |  Apple Music Yuno’s bittersweet vocals glide over a buoyant bass line and, fittingly, one of the song’s central themes is passing a point of no return. Yuno both stars in and directs the “No Going Back” video and offers this of the visual, “The video pretty much represents how I was feeling when I wrote this song. Kind of wandering around, not too sure about where I want to go, but definitely sure about where I don’t want to be. Just trying to make sure I have some fun along the way.” Yuno was introduced to the label by Ishmael Butler of Shabazz Palaces and Digable Planets fame, who’s a member of Sub Pop’s A&R staff. Butler offers his praise, “First time I heard Yuno, I peeped, of course, that he possessed all the trappings of a great musician, impeccable taste on his riffs, songs catchy but not corny, familiar but dopely strange. There was seductive magic that I couldn’t, and still can’t put my finger on, which is the essence of his uniqueness. Kids a star, man.” 27-year-old Yuno’s pedigree is diverse. His parents are from the UK, and of Jamaican descent, and his musical upbringing involved a wide array of discovery mainly as a result of being part of his local skateboarding subculture. That’s what got him into music: hanging out with friends at their now abandoned mall, going to the skate shop, playing  Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater  video games, watching skate videos, and listening to all the music featured therein. At home, he’d listen to reggae, ska, rocksteady and classic R&B, but it was skating that got him into rock and rap. Formative albums included ones his friends would pass along to him on burned CDs: HIM’s  Razorblade Romance , AFI’s  Sing The Sorrow  and Rancid’s … And Out Come The Wolves . He never really went to shows because rarely anyone worth seeing would come through. The first gig he attended was headlined by a rapper called MC Lars. That’s what made him consider starting a solo project – seeing one dude onstage, recreating all the music alone with a laptop. To this day, he’s only been to four shows. “I’m used to just watching them on YouTube,” he says. “ I never think about a live show when writing songs. I just make whatever.” He continues “I knew in high school that I wanted to make music. When I was really young, drawing had been my thing; and in middle school I started to make videos with my friends – little skits. Then I began playing guitar.” In eighth grade, his cousin taught him how to make beats, and that’s when Yuno arguably began. His dad also bought him a $20 guitar at a flea market. Despite his mom insisting he get lessons, he taught himself by learning online guitar tabs, mostly for metal bands. He says, “I’d bring my guitar to school every day. In high school, I had a lot of friends that played guitar, as well. We would all come to school early, learn songs and play for each other in the cafeteria.” Yuno creates his music in his home studio, self-producing, and engineering, playing all the instruments. He also shoots all of his press photos, designs his album art and directs his music videos, with a great amount of attention paid to the use of color throughout his work. He explains, “Pink has been my favorite color since around 6th grade. I had pink and black shoes, skateboard, and even painted my bedroom pink and black.

{"title": "Hear Forth Wanderers’ Take On The Ambivalence Of Love In “Not For Me,” From Their Forthcoming Self-Titled, Sub Pop Debut (out April 27th)", "date": "TUE, FEB 13, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "Sub Pop has signed Montclair, New Jersey’s  Forth Wanderers , and will release the group’s second full-length effort and label debut, worldwide on April 27th, 2018. The self-titled album features the standouts “Not for Me,” “Nevermine,” and “Ages Ago,” and was produced and recorded by Cameron Konner in Philadelphia over 5 days in the summer of 2017.   Forth Wanderers  will be available on CD/LP/CS/DL through Sub Pop  right here .  LP pre-orders through megamart.subpop.com and select independent retailers will receive the limited Loser edition on opaque orange vinyl. Forth Wanderers  Tracklisting 1. Nevermine 2. Company 3. Ages Ago 4. Taste 5. Not for Me 6. Be My Baby 7. New Face 8. Saunter 9. Tired Games 10. Temporary [ Photo Credit: Julia Leiby ] About Forth Wanderers: Forth Wanderers employ a tin-can-telephone style of composition which they use even when living in the same area code. Since first collaborating in 2013 as high schoolers, guitarist and songwriter Ben Guterl and vocalist Ava Trilling have passed songs back and forth like pen pals. Guterl will devise an instrumental skeleton before sending it to vocalist Ava Trilling who pens the lyrics based off the melody. The duo then gather alongside guitarist Duke Greene, bassist Noah Schifrin, and drummer Zach Lorelli to expand upon the demo. It’s a patient and practiced writing system that has carried the quintet through two EPs (2013’s  Mahogany  on  Seagreen Records  and 2016’s  Slop  on  Father/Daughter Records ) and one LP (2014’s self-released  Tough Love ). Forth Wanderers, the group’s sophomore record and Sub Pop debut, is the groups’ most comprehensive and assured statement yet.    Now living in Ohio and New York respectively, Guterl and Trilling have evolved their separate but collaborative writing process. “The only way I can really write is by myself in my room with a notebook, listening to the song over and over again,” Trilling says. “I’ve never sat down to write a story, I write the song as it unfolds.” Since her lyrics are often embedded with intimate truths from her life, the private writing experience often leads to intense self-reflection.   On  Forth Wanderers  these introspections include meditations on relationships, discovery, and finding oneself adrift. Despite the inherent heaviness of those themes,  Forth Wanderers  feels joyous, a rock record bursting with heart. Take “Not for Me,” a romping track about “the ambivalence of love.” Trilling’s confession of “I can’t feel the earth beneath my feet/Flowers bloom but not for me” resists feeling like a dreary, pitying complaint; instead, as her bandmates bolster her melancholy with interlocking harmonic intricacies, she soars with self-actualization. Opener “Nevermine,” is a surge of confidence inspired by an ex-lover who is still captivated by her image. I don’t think I know who you are anymore/ and I don’t think I knew I was before” she jabs with relish. On “Ages Ago” Trilling paints the image of a constantly-shifting enigmatic lover. “I wasn’t sure who they were, they changed constantly (hence the metaphor describing the “grey coat” and cutting their hair just to “stay afloat”),” she says. “I wasn’t going to wait any longer to find out.”   Recorded over five days by friend and audio engineer Cameron Konner at his Philadelphia home studio,  Forth Wanderers  amplifies the heartfelt sentiments of the band’s earlier works into massive anthems. Guterl and Greene’s guitars have never sounded so sharp, Schifrin and Lorelli’s terse rhythm section is restless, and Trilling seems more self-assured than ever. “We have embraced our roles in the collaboration process,” says Guterl. “Everyone’s gotten better at their instruments and we trust each other more because we know how the machine works.” This spirit soars through  Forth Wanderers , resulting in exuberant, profound songs driven by tightly bound melodies and a loving attention to detail.

The Other  will be out on Sub Pop Records this April 13th, and is available for pre-order  HERE NOW . Today you can also hear the official first single from the album, “Psycho Star.” It is a prime representation of King Tuff’s soulful and cosmic new direction. You’re now listen to the song via the Cameron Dutra directed visuals above. Thomas self-produced the record and brought in Shawn Everett (War On Drugs, Alabama Shakes) to assist with the mixing process. No less hooky than previous records, the new songs ditch the goofy rock-and-roll bacchanalia narratives of earlier records in favor of expansive arrangements, a diversity of instrumentation, and lyrics that straddle the fence between painful ruminations and reconnecting with that part of yourself that feels childlike and creative and not corroded by cynicism.  The record features contributions from Ty Segall (drums), Jenny Lewis (vocals), Greta Morgan (vocals), and Mikal Cronin (saxophone). Thomas views the entire experience of the record as a kind of psychic reset. “I let the songs lead me where they wanted to go, instead of trying to push them into a certain zone. King Tuff was always just supposed to be me. When I started doing this as a teenager, it was whatever I wanted it to be. King Tuff was never supposed to be just one thing. It was supposed to be everything.” The Other  tracklisting: The Other Raindrop Blue Thru The Cracks Psycho Star Infinite Mile Birds of Paradise Circuits in the Sand Ultraviolet Neverending Sunshine No Man’s Land King Tuff on Tour On top of all this good news, King Tuff has also announced a North American tour beginning May 3rd in San Diego.

I didn’t even know what I wanted to do anymore, but I still had this urge-this feeling-like there was this possibility of something else I could be doing… and then I just followed that possibility. To me, that’s what songwriting, and art in general, is about. You’re chasing something, there is something out there calling to you and you’re trying to get at it. ‘The Other’ is basically where songs come from. It’s the hidden world. It’s the mystery.

{"title": "Loma Share New Single “Joy” From Their Self-Titled Debut + New US and UK Tour Dates Are On The Books", "date": "WED, JAN 24, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "Loma , the new project comprised of Jonathan Meiburg, best known as the singer of  Shearwater , and Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski of  Cross Record , will release their self-titled debut album on February 16th via Sub Pop, with their first North American tour to follow. (dates are below.) After presenting singles “Black Willow” and “Relay Runner,” Loma shares the first song the trio wrote and recorded together, “Joy,” a song about the giddy, terrifying experience of falling in love, especially against your better judgment. Of that initial session, Meiburg noted “There was something special about the combination of the three of us, and very different from either of our bands. But I think we were afraid to say so out loud, for fear of jinxing it. I remember the hairs on the back of my neck standing up when Emily hit that high, screaming note on the clarinet on ‘Joy’; it sounded like a human voice.” That sense of discovery, stoked by the album’s urgent and searching lyrical themes, is felt throughout the entirety of Loma and extends to the listener.  [ Photo Credit: Bryan C.

Inspired by a 2017 trip to his grandparents’ birthplace of the Aeolian Islands off Sicily, singer/songwriter/guitarist Tom Russo describes how the track came together. “I was reading about a refugee crisis unfolding not far away in the Mediterranean Sea,” says Russo. “The song is about longing, disillusionment, privilege and holding on to love as a kind of shield.”  Recorded in a secluded house in Australia’s Northern NSW wilderness, “Mainland” marks the first taste of new music from the band since the release of their lauded 2017 EP “The French Press” (Sub Pop). The EP landed on many “Best Of 2017” lists, including The Guardian, Paste, and more.

In 1986 it was the post-hardcore chime of Pitchfork. In 1991 it was the sprawling, multi-faceted arrangements of Drive Like Jehu. In 1999 it was the lean, mean swagger of Hot Snakes. Reis and Froberg are responsible for some of the most turbulent rock and roll of their, or any, generation.   Hot Snakes streamlined Jehu’s complex compositions and emerged as bona fide downstroke warlords. They made 3 studio albums of high-velocity, slash-your-face, piss-punk: 2000’s  Automatic Midnight , 2002’s  Suicide Invoice  and 2004’s  Audit in Progress . The band ceased activity in 2005 but reunited for a triumphant world tour in 2011, planting the seeds for what has cum.   Now, after a 14-year hiatus from the studio, Hot Snakes have kicked down the door back into our lives with their new album,  Jericho Sirens , due out March 16 from Sub Pop. Fresh, warm piss, bottled and sold as lube.   “I considered stopping playing guitar on a social media poll after I completely mastered the instrument,” Reis says. “But so many people kept sending me letters and voicemail messages, asking me at the dry cleaners, or the butcher shop to bring back Hot Snakes. They were missing rock and roll music. I’ve always considered Hot Snakes to be more in the vein of the proto-Vog movement of the early ‘70s. But to these people, this is their rock ‘n’ roll. I understand that. I totally understand people’s desire to be controlled and humiliated by my guitar. Anyone can play the stupid guitar. What they want is for me to use it as a branding iron.”   The new album blasts out of the speakers with the furious “I Need a Doctor,” inspired by Froberg’s experience needing a doctor’s note in order to miss an important work function. “Yeah, I had to be quick on my feet,” says Rick. “Luckily a friend had a stack of stationary from Planned Parenthood and I used that to forge a note relieving me of my obligation to go to a really lame Christmas party at a karaoke joint.”   Throughout  Jericho Sirens , Froberg commiserates with the frustration and torrential apathy that seems to be a fixture in our daily lives, while also reminding us that we have no fucking clue. “Songs like ‘Death Camp Fantasy’ and ‘Jericho Sirens’ are about that,” he says. “No matter where you look, there’re always people saying the world’s about to end. Every movie is a disaster movie. I’m super fascinated by it. It is hysterical, and it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. It snowballs, like feedback, or my balls on the windshield.”   Musically, the album incorporates the most extreme fringes of the Hot Snakes sound (the vein-bulging, 78-second “Why Don’t It Sink In?” the manic, Asian Blues on speed of “Having Another?”), while staying true to longstanding influences such as the Wipers, Dead Moon, Michael Jackson, and Suicide on propulsive tracks such as “Six Wave Hold-Down,” one of the first songs written for the project during a Mummer Parade 2017 session in Philadelphia. Other moments like the choruses of “Jericho Sirens” and “Psychoactive” nod to Status Quo and AC/DC with Froberg admitting, “I still flip bird and ride my BMX on top of cop cars.”   “My muse was love. It sounds like panic and chaos,” Reis says. “Restlessness and unease. That’s a sound that I would ask for. I want that record. The inspiration would be simple, maybe even kind of straightforward. Very early rock ‘n’ roll DNA with lots of rules. I would find some note or rhythm in it that captivated me and I dwelled on it and bent it. That’s where I found dissonance. Bending and rubbing against each other uncomfortably. Marinate and refine. A lot of the other Hot Snakes records always had tension and release, but this one is mainly just tension.”   Jericho Sirens  was recorded in short bursts over the past year, mostly in San Diego and Philadelphia with longtime bassist Gar Wood, Jason Kourkounis and Mario Rubalcaba, both of whom drummed on prior Hot Snakes releases but never on the same one. For Reis, reactivating his creative partnership with Froberg was one of the most rewarding aspects of the process: “Our perspectives are similar. Our tastes are similar. He is my family. And what more is there to say? My favorite part of making this record was hearing him find his voice and direction for this record. I came hard.”   In tandem with a full back catalog reissue series and the new album, Hot Snakes will return to the road in 2018 to incinerate the villages, and they’re already looking ahead to more music. Says Gar Wood, “There’re already 2 more records written and recorded. We wanted to come out with this one using the more mainstream sounding stuff to give people a chance to catch up.”"},

To shoot the video we used practical effects to warp the viewers perception of what’s happening. It was appropriately shot in Los Angeles on 35mm film much like other disingenuous Hollywood productions” The FADER  had this to say  of the video, “The song is about what really lies beneath, and like the truth, “Artificial” is distressing, nuanced, and ultimately cathartic. In the video directed by A Stranger, Moaning’s members dress in all white and play in a tinfoiled  house with lots of fake plants, with their faces occasionally distorted and mirrored in very cool fashions (see  video premiere January 15th ).” Moaning  will be available on CD/LP/CS/DL worldwide through Sub Pop.  The 10-track album, featuring “Artificial” and “ Don’t Go ” along with highlights “Tired” “The Same,” and “Misheard,” was recorded and engineered by Alex Newport in Los Angeles.   Preorders for  Moaning  are available now through Sub Pop  right here .

But his voice rushes through a weathered industrial filter that makes it sound like the air in his lungs is struggling to catch up with him, adding a layer of momentum to his post-punk stoicism. Behind him, bandmates Pascal Stevenson and Andrew MacKelvie keep time on bass and drums, respectively, their clipped tempos like a clock ticking down to the end of the affair. And then there’s that delightfully out of place guitar solo. The way Solomon’s fingers jitter across the frets betrays the dispassion in his voice. He sings like Ian Curtis, but he plays guitar like Billie Joe Armstrong wringing out notes in fits.” [“Don’t Go”] -  Pitchfork   “It’s moody and on-edge, an energy that’s matched by the stylish black-and-white video”  [“Don’t Go”] -   Stereogum   “Don’t Go” is uproarious and unrelenting, a tremendous wall of noise hitting you from the start, its biting rage continuing throughout. Vocals cloaked in fuzz meld into the sounds projected seamlessly, creating a thick atmosphere against repetitious plea of, “don’t go.”…The single evokes the feelings of desperately holding on, clamoring to keep it together even when everything has fallen apart. This band is everything.”  [“Don’t Go”] -  The Grey Estates   “A product of their hometown’s DIY scene, this Los Angeles trio have spent the past couple of years creating moody guitar music that draws on shoegaze, slacker-rock and post-punk. They’ve already whetted appetites for their upcoming debut album with a series of driving, dirge-like, deadpan tunes.” [Top 40 Newcomers of 2018”] -   The Guardian"},

{"title": "Listen To The Explorative New Single “Jesse” From Frankie Cosmos - Their Sub Pop Debut ‘Vessel’ Will Be Out March 30th, 2018", "date": "THU, JAN 11, 2018 at 700 AM", "preview": "On March 30th, New York four-piece  Frankie Cosmos  will release their Sub Pop debut,  Vessel .  This 18-track opus finds bandleader Greta Kline’s distinctive songwriting voice enriched by the musical sensibilities of her bandmates– bassist/vocalist David Maine, keyboardist/vocalist Lauren Martin and drummer Luke Pyenson, who each played a role shaping the sound of the new record.  On the album’s first single “Jesse,” Kline works through feeling out of place, and trying to be more psychically in touch with herself. [Stop-motion animated visuals for this first track were expertly made by  Ariel Noltimier Strauss .] One of the early songs from  Vessel  that the band arranged, “Jesse” was tied together musically by the melodic and agile lead guitar playing of Alex Bailey, who later joined Frankie Cosmos full-time on bass. To record  Vessel , Frankie Cosmos traveled back up to Binghamton, New York to work with Hunter Davidsohn, the producer and studio engineer who helped craft the sound for  Zentropy  and  Next Thing,  at his studio Business District Recording. The band spent 3 days upstate live-tracking drums, bass, and guitars, as well as vocals, favoring the spontaneity of reel-to-reel tape over the meticulous perfectionism caused by recording digitally. Several songs are instrumental first or second-takes, highlighting a newfound collective energy felt by the band’s four members after months of touring, practicing, and arranging together.   For the next phase, Davidsohn joined the band in Brooklyn to record harmonies, keyboards, and other overdubs with Carlos Hernandez and Julian Fader of Ava Luna at their studio, Gravesend Recordings. As Frankie Cosmos started testing out new songs for  Vessel  on the road, the band invited members from their fellow touring bands to join them on stage to sing or play parts on tracks like “Being Alive” and “Jesse.” Once in the studio, the band decided to invite those same friends and more to contribute parts to the final recorded versions: Alex Bailey (formerly of Warehouse, who has replaced David Maine as a permanent member of the live band), Vishal Narang (of Airhead DC), and singer/songwriter Anna McClellan. After a total of 6 days of recording followed by group mixing sessions, Davidsohn put the finishing touches on the album back upstate and eventually sent the completed album to Josh Bonati to be mastered. Pre-orders for  Vessel  are available now through Sub Pop  right over here .  LP pre-orders through megamart.subpop.com and select independent retailers will receive the limited Loser edition on blue vinyl (while supplies last).

Like many of her peers, Kline’s prolific creative output was initially born out of an era where bedroom recording and self-releasing became more possible than ever through the advent of the internet. But as she’s grown as a writer and performer, playing to larger audiences and devising more complex albums, Kline has shifted from an artist who’s made strides despite limitations, to an artist whose impact can be seen across modern independent music. Her newest record,  Vessel , which will be out spring 2018 through Sub Pop Records, is the 52nd release from Kline and the third studio album by her indie-pop outfit Frankie Cosmos. On it, Kline explores all of the changes that have come in her life as a result of the music she has shared with the world for the past half-decade, as well as the parts of her life that have remained irrevocable.   Frankie Cosmos has taken several different shapes since their first full band album,  Zentropy,  erupted in New York’s DIY music scene in 2014. For  Vessel  the band’s line up comprises of guitarist/singer Greta Kline, bassist/vocalist David Maine, keyboardist/vocalist Lauren Martin, and drummer Luke Pyenson, who each contributed their own musical sensibilities to help shape the sound of the new record, both on their principal instruments and others. In between tours supporting their last album,  Next Thing , Kline brought new songs to the band’s rehearsals, and together the members collectively participated in turning them into full-band arrangements. As a result, the album’s staggering 18 tracks implement a range of instrumentations and recording methods unheard of on the albums preceding it, while still maintaining the succinctly sincere nature of Kline’s songwriting.   The album’s opening track, “Caramelize,” serves as the thematic overture for  Vessel , alluding to topics like dependency, growth, and love which reoccur throughout the record. The song strings together a scope of musical motifs and showcases the intense dynamics in both Kline’s lyrics and the band’s performance that continue on the tracks that follow. Although many of the scenarios and personalities written about on  Vessel   are familiar territory for Frankie Cosmos, what’s really changed on the new record is Kline’s nuanced point of view and her desire to constantly question the latent meaning of her experiences. In the album’s first single “Jesse,” Kline grapples with the startling personal epiphanies in life that stem from dreams and subconscious realizations. On another single, “Apathy,” Kline confronts her own insecurities around personal change and feeling distant from the people she once had a close relationship with. Then later on the album “Accommodate,” deals with the complexity of being in a community that would rather turn its nose to a problem than hold its members accountable. “Being Alive” stands out as one of the few old Bandcamp-era Frankie Cosmos songs the band reworked for  Vessel , and shows the rhythm section quickly shifting between fast and slow tempos as Kline ponders the minutia of existence. Kline’s dissonant lyrics are paired with the band’s driving, jangly grooves creating several moments on the album where the bandmates’ chemistry playing together is brought to the forefront.   Vessel’s  run time is exactly double the length of Frankie Cosmos’ breakout record,  Zentropy , and serves as enormous leap forward in the band’s catalog. But ultimately, the album’s unique sensibility, esoteric narratives, and reveling energy, allow it to exist as just another distinctive chapter in Kline’s ongoing musical autobiography. Through  Vessel , Kline provides the listener with a spectrum of disparate anecdotes, observations, and affirmations and then tasks them with arranging the pieces in a way that they can make their own sense of. Typically albums by artists at a similar stage in their career are written with the weight of knowing that someone is on the other end listening. Yet, despite bringing attention to her audience in direct references, Kline and the rest of Frankie Cosmos have passionately written  Vessel  with a clarity not muddled by the fear of meeting anyone’s expectation."},

[‘Relay Runner’ is] truly lovely.” —  Stereogum “Immediately engrossing” –  GoldFlakePaint “Sounds like three musicians wildly in love.” –  Monster Children “A manifestation of brilliant musical minds in organic workspaces” –  The Line of Best Fit Loma , the new project comprised of Jonathan Meiburg, best known as the singer of  Shearwater , and Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski of  Cross Record , will release their self-titled debut album on February 16th via Sub Pop. The band just extended their first North American tour into May (find dates below). A product of a joint pilgrimage around the globe by fellow touring musicians, Loma is a beautifully detailed and emotionally rich album “full of mystery and wonder” (NPR Music). After presenting the lead single, “Black Willow,” Loma now shared “Relay Runner” and have now followed up with the video, directed by Allison Beondé and Cross.  As Cross describes it, “This song is about transitioning from one state to another… specifically from the feeling of being boxed in and trapped to the feeling of freedom and liberation. It is about the ongoing drive to attain that movement. I think of the ‘relay’ as the endless series of versions of yourself that each hand off to the next version of yourself. Beyond that, I wanted to express unbridled joy–for being alive, for moving my body, for being able to build myself a human dog agility course from supplies I bought at the Home Depot.” In creating Loma, the trio convened in a house in the Texas hill country over a few months during a strangely charged time. When they began recording, Cross and Duszynski were a married couple, but their relationship ended during the sessions—an atmosphere Meiburg found both challenging and inspiring—and the isolated house became the album’s muse. Except for Cross’s translucent voice in the foreground, there were no assigned roles on the album; each member of the trio played every instrument as needed. This feeling of freedom let buried energies find expression. Cross wrung catharsis from Meiburg’s lyrics and melodies, while Duszynski immersed himself in the engineering and mixing. Loma is available for preorder from Sub Pop  right here .  North American preorders of the limited Loser edition from  megamart.subpop.com  will be available on clear vinyl with red and black swirlies (while supplies last).

The abrasive, post punk trio comprised of Sean Solomon, Pascal Stevenson, and Andrew MacKelvie, began nearly a decade after they met in L.A.’s DIY music scene. Their debut album comes born out of the member’s experiences with love and distress, creating a sound uniquely dark and sincere. Although the band is just breaking out of their infancy, Moaning’s sleek and cavernous tone emphasizes the turmoil of the era they were born into. One where the endless possibility for art and creation is met with the fear and doubt of an uncertain future. The trio began regularly frequenting DIY institutions like The Smell and Pehrspace, eventually selling out dozens of their own shows at both venues with their first few bands. Solomon recalls, after a brief hiatus from playing together, Moaning’s conception came when he sent Stevenson and MacKelvie the first demo for “Don’t Go,” setting the tone for the impulsive songwriting that would follow.  The three fleshed out Solomon’s primitive recordings, adding in MacKelvie’s heavy syncopated drumming, and Stevenson’s melodic driving bass and synth parts, capturing each member’s personality in their sparse and fuzzed out tracks. Like many of their previous collaborative projects, Moaning forces pain up against pleasure, using the complexity of personal heartbreak to inform the band’s conflicted sound. The band eventually landed on the apt moniker Moaning, admiring the ambiguity the name held and hoping to reference both an intimate wail and an anguished scream [ r ead more here ]."},

The veteran pianist recorded the songs live on October 9th, 2016 at the famed Canlis Restaurant in Seattle, Washington [ purchase here ].   Stream:  Apple Music  /  Spotify   Charles Darwin said it best: adapt or die. Okay, maybe that’s not an exact quote, but the great English scientist was definitely on to something. Organisms that respond over time to the ever-changing environment are more likely to survive and thrive.   While you may not find this crazy idea in Junior’s textbooks these days, it’s audible in every facet of Walt Wagner’s  Reworks . With its distinctive renditions of songs popularized by DJ Shadow, My Bloody Valentine, Fleet Foxes, and more, this live recording of the beloved pianist’s farewell performance shows how three Seattle institutions – Wagner, Canlis restaurant, and Sub Pop Records – have evolved over the years.     When veteran pianist Wagner first landed at Canlis in 1996, the Emerald City’s premiere destination for fine dining was in the midst of significant changes: a new chef, new uniforms, modifications to its iconic building overlooking Lake Union. That required a fresh approach to dinner music, too. “I knew what the status quo was, but the owners wanted new energy,” recalls Wagner.   Although he started out with a set heavy on the Great American Songbook and the occasional pop tune, that gradually gave way to more adaptations of modern fare. “Increasingly I kept working in more new, edgier music. In the beginning my sets were 90 percent standards. In the last few years, I was mostly playing very contemporary music.” As young staff members recommended new artists and songs, Wagner’s repertoire grew deeper and more varied – especially after the next generation of the Canlis family took over in 2003. Yet whether the source material was Pink Floyd, Prince, Metallica, or the Weeknd, the challenge remained the same: “To distill the vibe on a record, the very essence of a song, into solo piano playing.” Performances as memorable yet tasteful as the cuisine, interiors, and views of Canlis [ read more at Sub Pop ].

Today, the trio presents the video for the album’s final song and lead single,  “ Black Willow .” [ Photo Credit:  Bryan C. Parker ] Meiburg, Duszynski and Cross became friends when Cross Record, on their first-ever tour, supported Shearwater throughout America and Europe in 2016. “I couldn’t believe all that sound was coming out of two people,” he says. “They were mesmerizing.”  In the van or at soundchecks, they shared their musical knowledge and love of nature and animals, and after an especially memorable show in Belgium, Meiburg approached Cross and Duszynski about working together. “I fell in love with their music,” he admits, “and I wanted to know how they did it.” The trio convened in a house in the Texas hill country to see what would happen, and quickly realized an album was imminent. “There was something powerful about the combination of the three of us,” Meiburg says, “and very different from either of our bands. But I think we were afraid to say so out loud, for fear of jinxing it.” For the next few months, Loma met for two weeks at a time, shaping and revising new songs and casting others away. It was also a strangely charged time. When the album began, Cross and Duszynski were a married couple, but their relationship ended during the sessions—an atmosphere Meiburg found both challenging and inspiring—and the isolated house became the album’s muse. Dogs wander by the microphones; the sounds of birds and wind in junipers and live oaks hover at the borders of the songs, and a close listen reveals cicadas and frogs from a nearby stream. Except for Cross’s translucent voice in the foreground, there were no assigned roles on the album; each member of the trio played every instrument as needed. This feeling of freedom let buried energies find expression. Cross wrung catharsis from Meiburg’s lyrics and melodies, while Duszynski immersed himself in the sonic details of engineering and mixing. In the end, the record became a document of an urgent and ephemeral place and time, and the strength that comes with letting go of something precious. It closes, fittingly, with the subtly defiant marching anthem of “Black Willow,” in which Cross’s voice, backed by a hypnotic bass and drums, offers a lesson in survival. “When I walk,” she sings, “I carry a diamond blade.” She means it.

{"title": "Watch the Cinematic New Lyric Video for “Heartbreak Junky” off Kyle Craft’s Second Album ‘Full Circle Nightmare’, In Stores February 2018", "date": "THU, NOV 9, 2017 at 700 AM", "preview": "Dinner Party Download  performance at  The Moore Theatre in Seattle on Thursday, November 16th Kyle Craft ’s  Full Circle Nightmare [preorder  here ] , his highly anticipated second album, will be released worldwide on February 2nd, 2018 from Sub Pop. The 10-track album was produced by Chris Funk (of the Decemberists), with mixing by Trevor Spencer and the Helio Sequence’s Benjamin Weikel and Brandon Summers.  Full Circle Nightmare  is the follow up to  Dolls of Highland , his acclaimed debut.   Album highlight “Heartbreak Junky” is the first offering (and cinematic lyric video) from  Full Circle Nightmare . Directed by the One Hundred/Swanson Studio team, the visual brings an already vivid album cover to life.  The  Full Circle Nightmare  front and inside gatefold images were shot by brothers Peter and Laki Karavias. The cover art concept was born from an idea Craft had that incorporated imagery from the lyricism found throughout the album. “Once everyone all piled into the room, it took a different turn,’ Craft says. “Some of the lyrical elements stuck around on the cover and on the inside fold, but for the most part it just turned into a small party and my pals Peter and Laki caught some perfect moments.” The Louisiana-bred, Portland, Oregon-based Craft has earned notices for his observational storytelling talents, his incredible stage performances, and his uniquely compelling voice. Since the release of  Dolls of Highland , he and his band have toured the US multiple times, both as headliners and supporting the likes of Fruit Bats and Drive-By Truckers, and Kyle has made repeat guest appearances at Newport Folk Fest.   Between the extensive touring and working on  Full Circle Nightmare , he’s delivered both new material  (the politically-charged “Before the Wall”)  and beautifully earnest covers (the recently-released  Girl Crazy  covers series; Leonard Cohen’s “Chelsea Hotel No. 2”).   Full Circle Nightmare  is a straight-up, rollicking rock’n’roll album; it traverses all the different nuances of the genre; it’s a timeless piece that could exist in any of the past five decades. All the songs were written over a year, and eventually, Craft took them into a studio run by Chris Funk. It was the first time he worked with a proper set-up. He was used to making all his music in his room with the aid of a laptop. “I always wanted to go to a legitimate studio and do what my all my old heroes did,” Craft says. “We did it live with the band.” The joy of the experience is palpable. It evokes a never-ending night out in a sweaty saloon bar: bottomless rounds, endless packs of cigarettes and hours dancing to the jukebox (read full bio at  Sub Pop ).   Full Circle Nightmare  is now  available for preorder  from Sub Pop and select independent retailers [see here], and will be available in the following formats: LP gatefold jacket with custom dust sleeve CD digipack with poster insert Cassette Digital North American preorders of the limited Loser edition will be available on maroon vinyl with a black swirl (while supplies last), and we also have a new T-shirt design with this release.   [ Photo Credit: Photo Credit: Jeremy Kale Padot ] Kyle Craft Tour Dates +  Ticket Links Kyle Craft has scheduled his first appearance in support of  Full Circle Nightmare  at the Dinner Party Download’s live event at Seattle’s Moore Theatre on Thursday, November 16th, 2017.

But you also hear the influences of David Bowie, under whose spell Craft fell at a young age, and of Craft’s adopted hometown of Portland, Oregon.”  -  World Cafe   “…Craft’s music is so full of its own weird singularity that he’s onto something far beyond idol worship. “-  Billboard   “His songs illustrate how the intense religiosity and voodoo-infused mythology of the South make it fertile turf for the sort of colorful characterization and freak-scenery on which glam rock was founded.” -  Pitchfork   Craft displays the full prowess of his vocal range, hitting high notes that hark back to glam rock vocals of the ’70s” -  American Songwriter   “…a head-turning mix, a sort of pop-art take on Southern gothic, and highly infectious.” -  Uncut   “One of the most distinctive new voices in rock.” -  SPIN"},

Well, since you asked… “Hoop has been a free spirit, but with  Memories Are Now , she understands exactly when to use the bridle and bit on these wild, wise songs.”  [4/5] –  MOJO   “Her most complete and refined statement yet, a boisterously declarative album that’s urgent and at times seditious.” -  Pitchfork   “One of her best albums to date. Stunning.” -  The Sunday Times   “This project has an air of rebirth to it. Hoop and her producer, Blake Mills, have worked to minimize her trademark lush arrangements to make  Memories  more reminiscent of a live setting. The spare “Animal Kingdom Chaotic” is built around fingerpicked string-work and typewriter clicks. Its Americana-leaning follow-up, “Simon Says,” relies only on a lightly distorted six-string, an upright bass and Hoop’s layered harmonies.” -  PASTE   “ In both content and construction, Jesca Hoop’s songs practically burst with ideas: They’re as strange and smart and heartfelt as they are gorgeous, and that’s saying something.” [ Memories Are Now , “First Listen”] -  NPR Music   “…A raw representation of Hoop’s formidable songwriting talents.” [ Memories Are Now ] -  MAGNET   “ Memories Are Now  is built on stacked voices, sparse rhythm and twisted folk shapes, but the execution varies pleasingly, from the Native American blues of “Cut Connection” to the autumnal bucolia of “Songs Of Old.”  [ Memories Are Now , 8/10] -  Uncut   “Past, present, and future rest patiently before Hoop, and she’s weaved them all into her most endearing album yet.” [ Memories Are Now , 10/10] -  Drowned in Sound   “ Memories Are Now  is a gorgeously delivered elegy to heartbreak and loss; powerful, perfectly executed songs to bring comfort and strength to the weary, broken and scorned.” [ Memories Are Now , 5/5] -  The Skinny   “There is something compellingly unique and hard to pigeonhole here.” - [ Memories Are Now , 4/5 ‘Album of the Week’] -  The Guardian"}
